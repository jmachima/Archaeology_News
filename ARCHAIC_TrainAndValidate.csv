CINCINNATI, OHIO—According to a statement released by the University of Cincinnati , a team of scientists analyzed layers of sediments collected from ten reservoirs in the Maya city of Tikal, which is located in northern Guatemala. Founded in the third century B.C., the city was abandoned by the ninth century A.D., when a series of droughts occurred. The researchers detected toxic levels of cyanobacteria in the water near Tikal’s central temple. Biologist David Lentz said consuming this water, even if it had been boiled, would have made people ill, especially during droughts. Algae blooms would have made the water look and taste bad anyway, added anthropologist Kenneth Tankersley. Mercury in the reservoir near the city’s palace was traced to cinnabar, a red pigment used to paint murals and decorate buildings and pottery. When it rained, mercury is thought to have leached from the pigment and collected in the reservoir, since analysis of the sediment with energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirmed that the contamination did not come from the underlying bedrock, Tankersley said. The scientists concluded that Tikal’s residents are likely to have relied on other reservoirs in the city for uncontaminated drinking water, while the pools in the center of the city probably served as symbols of Maya rulers’ control over the water supply.

PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA—According to a report in The Phnom Penh Post , two pieces of a six-foot-tall statue of a lion were unearthed by mine-clearing experts preparing the site of a new groundwater reservoir along the Tonle Sap River. Hab Touch of Cambodia’s Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said the large size of the statue suggests it may have been part of a bridge. Further study of the sculpture at the National Museum could offer clues to when it was carved. “We cannot make assumptions of the lion that we found during mine clearance for the reservoir plan because we don’t have any connections regarding the statue,” explained museum director Chhay Visoth. “Normally, we can know the date of an artifact by identifying other things around it.” "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8716-200526-spain-hugh-o-donnell,Medieval,"Archaeologists in Spain Seek Grave of 16th-Century Irish Hero. VALLADOLID, SPAIN— The Irish Times reports that a team of researchers led by archaeologist Óscar Burón have uncovered human remains at what may be the burial place of Red Hugh O’Donnell, an Irish nobleman who led a rebellion against the government in Ireland and died in Spain in 1602, after attempting to persuade Spanish king Philip III to send additional troops to Ireland to continue the fight against the English. Historical accounts record that O’Donnell’s body was carried to the king’s palace in Valladolid and then buried in the so-called Chapel of Marvels at a Franciscan convent, where Christopher Columbus was first buried after his death in 1506. O’Donnell’s grave was lost when the convent was demolished in 1836. Burón said the researchers should be able to identify O’Donnell’s remains because he lost his big toes to frostbite in 1591 while hiding in the mountains after escaping from prison in Dublin. "

HAIFA, ISRAEL—Meir Edrey and his colleagues Adi Erlich and Assaf Yasur Landau, all of the University of Haifa, have analyzed pottery and clay figurines recovered in 1972 from an underwater site off the coast of western Galilee, according to a New York Times report. It had been previously thought that the hundreds of figurines and jars, which were found in a jumble on the seafloor, were cargo on a Phoenician ship that sank in the Mediterranean Sea some 2,500 years ago. Edrey now suggests that the items, which vary in style, were deposited as offerings between the seventh and third centuries B.C. by members of a cult devoted to fertility and seafaring. Many of the figurines bear symbols associated with the mother goddess Tanit; dolphin symbols, which are also associated with Tanit; or depict a pregnant woman carrying a child. The researchers think the pottery may have been cast into the water as a ritual or a symbolic sacrifice. The position of the hands in some of the figurines, with the right hand upright and the left below the mouth, may indicate a vow in exchange for divine favor, Edrey added. "

KRISTIANSAND, NORWAY— CBS News reports that the 571-foot German warship Karlsruhe was found under 1,600 feet of water off the coast of Norway by the power company Statnett with multibeam echo sounders and a remotely operated vehicle. The ship, equipped with nine cannons and three triple turrets, led the invasion of Norway on April 9, 1940, but was struck by a British submarine torpedo on its return trip. The crew of the Karlsruhe evacuated the ship and then scuttled it. The vessel now rests upright on the seafloor, about 50 feet away from a power cable connecting Norway and Denmark that was laid in 1977. "

TULSA, OKLAHOMA— Tulsa World reports that researchers looking for the remains of victims of Tulsa's 1921 Race Massacre have found an unmarked trench holding the poorly preserved remains of ten wooden coffins in Oaklawn Cemetery. The trench was found near a single burial discovered earlier this week, in an area of the cemetery noted in old funeral home records as a burial site for some of the 300 Black people killed by a white mob on May 31 and June 1, 1921. State archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck said the single burial differs slightly from the burials in the trench. The bones in the trench, she added, are too fragile to examine in place, and so will remain covered while the research team makes plans to exhume them. “We have a lot of work to do to determine the nature of [this] mass grave and who is buried in it, but what we can say is that we have a mass grave in Oaklawn Cemetery where we have no record of anyone being buried,” commented city mayor G.T. Bynum. "

LUXOR, EGYPT—According to an Ahram Online report, several structures were uncovered during an excavation at the Avenue of Sphinxes, a ceremonial passageway lined with ram-headed sculptures that once connected temples in Luxor and Karnak. Mudbrick kilns dating to the Roman period (30 B.C.–A.D. 640) are thought to have been used to fire pottery. A wall dated to the Egyptian Late Period (712–332 B.C.) would have protected Luxor from the floodwaters of the Nile River. Another 100-foot-long section of wall made of sandstone blocks still stands about eight feet tall and ten feet wide. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8670-200504-england-seated-burial,Bronze Age,"Unusual Bronze Age Burials Found in England. GLOUCESTERSHIRE, ENGLAND— Live Science reports that two Bronze Age burials situated within a circular ditch were unearthed in southwestern England by a team including Andy Hood of Foundations Archaeology. The first burial, placed in the center of the circle, contained the remains of a possible chieftain, who had been placed in the grave on his side in a crouched position. The skulls and hooves of four cattle, a copper dagger with a whale-bone pommel, a stone wrist guard, an amber bead, and a flint and iron pyrite for starting fires were also found in the grave. The second grave, found near the first, held the remains of an older man placed in a seated position, and the skull and hooves of one animal. Radiocarbon dating of the burials indicates the men lived around 4,200 years ago, and the artifacts in both burials indicate the men might have been members of the Beaker culture. “One of the mysteries is, what was the relationship between those two men?” Hood asked. He explained that the chieftain’s burial is the only such burial in Britain to hold the parts of multiple cattle. “It’s quite a significant investment of wealth to go into the ground.” He added that the older man’s seated burial is also considered to be unusual. “We haven’t found a direct parallel elsewhere in Bronze Age Britain.” "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/9177-201030-china-denisovan-dna,Pre-Human,"Denisovan DNA Dated in China. LANZHOU, CHINA— Science News reports that Dongju Zhang of Lanzhou University and her colleagues have dated Denisovan mitochondrial DNA found in the layers of sediments in Baishiya Karst Cave on the Tibetan Plateau, which is located some 1,700 miles to the northwest of Siberia’s Denisova Cave, where Denisovan remains were first identified. Stone tools and animal bones were also recovered from the layers. Zhang said the presence of Denisovan genetic material in Baishiya Karst Cave suggests that Denisovans lived on the Tibetan Plateau some 100,000 years ago, and then again 60,000 years ago. DNA in layers dated to between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago further suggest that the hominins could have encountered modern humans, who arrived in the region some 40,000 years ago. Interbreeding with Denisovans may have helped modern humans adapt to living at the high altitude of the Tibetan Plateau, although it is not clear if that mixing took place there. Zhang said the study also suggests that Denisovan populations were widespread in eastern Eurasia. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8531-200318-russia-mammoth-bones,Paleolithic,"Massive Mammoth-Bone Structure Found in Kostenki, Russia. EXETER, ENGLAND— Haaretz reports that a circular structure measuring about 41 feet in diameter has been found near western Russia’s Don River by an international team of researchers led by Alexander Pryor of the University of Exeter. Two smaller mammoth-bone circles have been found nearby. Made of the bones of at least 60 mammoths, the newly uncovered bone circle is thought to be 25,000 years old. Traces of scattered wood fires, burned bones, food remains, and a few stone tools have been found within it, but the researchers suggest Paleolithic people did not consume daily meals at the site. It had been previously thought that bones were the only fuel available to people who built such Ice Age shelters. “The growth ring widths in the charcoal we recovered are mostly very narrow, suggesting that trees were clinging on at the edge of their tolerance limits,” Pryor explained. He added that some of the bones in the ring were articulated, indicating they had been added to the structure along with their cartilage and fat, making the dwelling a smelly draw for wolves, foxes, and other scavengers. Future research will investigate if the structure could have been used for food storage or as a winter gathering place. "

ROSSETT, WALES— The Shropshire Star reports that a metal detectorist alerted a local finds officer for the Portable Antiquities Scheme in Wales after uncovering the corner of a metal object that appeared to have markings on it. Archaeologists from Wrexham Museum and the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust who reported to the scene unearthed a large lead ingot measuring about one and one-half feet long and weighing nearly 140 pounds. The writing on the possibly ancient ingot turned out to be a cast Latin inscription mentioning Marcus Trebellius Maximus, governor of the province of Britannia from A.D. 63 to 69. “We don’t yet know where this ingot has come from and we will probably never know where it was going to,” said Finds Officer Susie White. “However given the find spots of other ingots from Britain of similar date, it may have been destined for continental Europe, perhaps even Rome itself.” "

CANTERBURY, ENGLAND—According to a statement released by the University of Kent , Christopher Dunmore, Matthew Skinner, and Tracy Kivell suggest that Australopithecus sediba could use its hands to climb trees as well as to manipulate objects in a modern human–like manner. Australopithecus sediba lived about two million years ago, and was a late-surviving member of the ape-like Australopithecus genus, which is thought to have gone extinct about 1.9 million years ago. The researchers examined the internal structure of the knuckles and thumb joints of Australopithecus sediba , Australopithecus africanus , Australopithecus afarensis , Neanderthals, and modern humans. The fossils ranged in age from three million to 12 thousand years old. The study suggests that Australopithecus sediba , unlike other members of the Australopithecus genus, had knuckles associated with being able to grasp branches, and thumb joints consistent with the modern human–like manipulation of objects.

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA—According to a Science Alert report, Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg suggests that poison-arrow technology may be tens of thousands of years older than previously thought. She analyzed bone-tipped arrowheads dated to the Paleolithic, and compared them to arrows known to have been used with poison, and arrows known to have been used without poison. Typically, arrows used with poison are smaller because they only need to reach an animal’s bloodstream to deliver a deadly substance, while arrows used without poison must inflict a wound that will incapacitate or kill an animal. Lombard found that three out of six bone-pointed arrows recovered from South Africa’s Blombos Cave, dating to between 72,000 and 80,000 years ago, resemble poisoned arrowheads, and are so small that they would probably have been ineffective without an added poison punch. Lombard cautions that further study of a larger sample of Paleolithic arrowheads is needed. "

SWANSEA, WALES— Science News reports that Richard Johnston of Swansea University and his colleagues used a micro-CT scanner to create highly detailed 3-D models of mummies held in the university’s Museum of Egyptian Antiquities for virtual examination. The mummies are estimated to be about 2,000 years old. The results of the study were so detailed that the researchers were able to determine that a domestic kitten in a cat-shaped mummy was less than five months old based on its unerupted molars. An oval mummy bundle held the remains of an Egyptian cobra. Rocklike structures placed in the snake’s open mouth may be chunks of natron, a mineral used by ancient Egyptian embalmers to slow decomposition. When preparing the bodies of humans, embalmers often propped open snakes' mouths and eyes so that the dead would be able to see and communicate with the living. Thus, the snake’s open mouth suggests it may have been intended to act as a messenger. A Eurasian kestrel was identified in a third bird-shaped mummy. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8550-200327-maine-colonial-ship,Modern,"Colonial-Era Shipwreck Identified in Maine. YORK, MAINE—Researcher Stefan Claesson has determined that the remains of a ship that periodically appear in the shifting sands of southern Maine date to the mid-eighteenth century, according to a Seacoast Online report. The hull currently measures about 50 feet long, but Claesson thinks the narrow vessel was about 60 feet long when it was built. “I believe it is the sloop Defiance ,” Claesson said. “I think the ship is a pink, a type of cargo ship.” Claesson said he mapped the site with a drone and geographic information system technology. Wood samples analyzed by the Cornell University Tree-Ring Laboratory were found to be from trees cut down in 1753. Using that information as a starting point, Claesson then examined notary records kept by Daniel Moulton between 1750 and 1794, and found that the Defiance ran aground in Cape Neddick Cove in 1769. “ Defiance fit every description,” he explained. Additional research revealed that on its last journey, the Defiance left Salem, Massachusetts, and was headed for Portland, Maine’s Casco Bay, carrying a crew of four, flour, pork, and other supplies when it hit rocks in Cape Neddick Cove during a storm. The crew survived, but the ship was lost. Claesson has also recommended procedures to protect the wreckage from further damage. Photographs taken of the ship in the 1950s and the 1970s show that its mast has since been cut off. "

COLUMBUS, OHIO— Cosmos Magazine reports that 8,000-year-old fluted arrowheads have been uncovered in Yemen and in Oman. Chipping off flakes from a stone to shape it is a highly skilled process that had been previously thought to be limited to toolmakers who lived in North America between 13,000 and 10,000 years ago. In North America, such fluting is usually found near the base of a point, and is thought to have facilitated attaching it to an arrow or spear shaft with string. In contrast, fluting has been found near the tip on points from southern Arabia. “Of course, we can’t say for sure, but we think this was a way for skilled toolmakers to signal something to others, perhaps that one is a good hunter… or dexterous with one’s hands,” said Joy McCorriston of Ohio State University. Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History added that the discovery of fluted points in southern Arabia serves as an example of “independent invention” on different continents.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/9081-201006-israel-heated-tools,Pre-Human,"Hominins in Israel May Have Controlled Fire 300,000 Years Ago. REHOVOT, ISRAEL—According to a Gizmodo Australia report, hominins living in central Israel’s Qesem Cave some 300,000 years ago heated their flint at varying temperatures before knapping it into different tools. Heating the stone would have given the toolmakers more control of the knapping process, but if done incorrectly, the rock would have broken and become unusable. Archaeologist Filipe Natalio of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and his colleagues evaluated two types of flint tools recovered from Qesem Cave with spectroscopic chemical analysis, and then heated flint samples in a laboratory oven in order to estimate the temperatures to which the ancient stones had been heated. They found that the blades had been heated to nearly 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while the flakes had been heated to 775 degrees. Pot lids recovered from the cave had been heated to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. While the study suggests that hominins were able to control fire and manage the resources necessary to keep it burning, the scientists still do not know the techniques the hominins might have employed.

SZEKSZÁRD, HUNGARY—A new study led by Corina Knipper of the Curt Engelhorn Center of Archaeometry suggests that central Europeans who practiced skull-binding lived alongside other cultures in the Roman province of Pannonia Valeria, in what is now western Hungary, during the political instability of the fifth century A.D., according to a Live Science report. The researchers divided the remains of individuals from 96 graves in the Mözs cemetery, 51 of which had elongated skulls, into three generations who lived between A.D. 430 and 470. The oldest remains in the cemetery were interred in Roman-style graves. The middle group was buried in a different manner, and the last burials in the cemetery combined practices of Roman and other traditions. Modified skulls were found in all three groups. About 30 percent of the oldest burials had elongated heads, while about 65 percent of the middle group and 70 percent of the last group showed signs of head binding. The researchers noted that the placement of grooves in the skulls changed over time, indicating that different binding techniques were used among different groups. Chemical analysis of the bones showed that some of the later residents had been born near the cemetery, while others had settled there after growing up somewhere else. The researchers concluded that residents of Pannonia Valeria mingled and adopted each other’s cultural habits as the Roman Empire collapsed. "

HALLE, GERMANY—According to a statement released by Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), researchers from MLU, Korkyt-Ata Kyzylorda State University, the University of Tübingen, and Russia’s Higher School of Economics analyzed a nearly complete cat skeleton unearthed at a medieval village site in southern Kazakhstan and determined the feline was likely kept as a pet. Located along the Silk Road, the village was home to the Oghuz, who were Turkic pastoralists. Ashleigh Haruda of MLU said the eighth-century tomcat had several healed broken bones, and had likely been fed by humans because it had lost all of its teeth. She added that the feline’s remains were only recovered because the animal had been buried, in contrast to most of the other animal bones recovered from the site, which were found individually. In addition, the chemical composition of the cat bones indicates the animal was fed a diet that contained more protein than dogs whose remains have been found at the site, and to other cats that lived during the same time period. Finally, genetic analysis suggests the cat belonged to the domesticated species Felis catus Linnaeus . The keeping of a pet cat is thought to be an unusual practice for the Oghuz and may be a sign of cultural exchange brought about by contact with Silk Road traders, Haruda and her team concluded. "

Traces of a species of tobacco plant not currently grown in the region were also detected in the pipes. Korey Brownstein of the University of Chicago suggests smooth sumac may have been mixed with tobacco for its medicinal qualities. It may have also improved the flavor of the smoke, he added. Analysis of residues in a pipe used by Native Americans in the period after contact with Europeans detected the presence of a tobacco plant grown by Native Americans living on the East Coast. Researcher Shannon Tushingham said it had been previously thought that plants grown by Europeans had come to dominate the post-contact trade in tobacco. "

WILTSHIRE, ENGLAND— The New York Times reports that 50 of the 52 sarsen stones at Stonhenge, the roughly 5,000-year-old Neolithic-period henge monument on England's Salisbury Plain, were quarried at a location roughly fifteen miles away. Using a combination of geochemical and statistical analyses, a multidisciplinary team of archaeologists and geologists identified a chemical signature for the megaliths, including all 15 standing stones that form the site's iconic inner horseshoe. They compared this signature to other chemical signatures taken from sarsens—a vernacular term for duricrust silcrete—at 20 sites across Great Britain. The dataset comparison resulted in a single match, an area on the southern edge of Wiltshire's Marlborough Downs called West Woods. The visual similarity of sarsen boulders on the Marlborough Downs to the Stonehenge megaliths led historian and writer William Lambarde to suggest the Downs as the origin for the monument's sarsens as early as the sixteenth century. Antiquarian John Aubrey postulated a specific connection between West Woods and Stonehenge a century later. However, s cholars have known for decades that the smaller, so-called bluestones near the center of Stonehenge were dragged, rolled, or carried there from a quarry some 180 miles away in Wales, so the team did not rule out the possibility that the sarsens were imported from a great distance.

PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA— CNN reports that Kevin Hatala of Chatham University and his colleagues have analyzed more than 400 footprints in 17 trackways at the site of Engare Sero in northern Tanzania. The footprints were found in volcanic mudflow that dried and hardened between 5,760 and 19,100 years ago, before it was covered with layers of protective sediments. Based on comparisons with footprints made by living people, the study suggests these footprints were left behind by 14 adult females, two adult males, and one juvenile male traveling in a group. The researchers then compared the footprint patterns with those made by modern hunter-gatherers, such as the Hadza of Tanzania and the Aché of Paraguay. “One scenario in which this kind of group structure is observed is during cooperative foraging activities, in which several adult females forage together, perhaps accompanied by one or two adult males for some portion of that time,” Hatala explained. “Infants may be carried, but young children who are old enough to walk will often stay behind rather than participate in foraging activities.” "

JENA, GERMANY—According to a statement released by the Max Planck Society for the Science of Human History , molecular paleopathologist Kirsten Bos and her colleagues looked for DNA evidence of disease in human remains discovered in a fifteenth-century mass grave in a cemetery in Vilnius, Lithuania. The study indicates that many of them died of the plague, but one of the women also suffered from yaws, a disease related to modern syphilis that is only found today in the tropics. Bos said the yaws genome was only slightly different than the ancestor of all known yaws varieties in humans and other primates, suggesting it developed about 1,000 years ago. The presence of yaws in the medieval grave, she added, could be related to a European outbreak of disease that began in the late fifteenth century, which has usually been attributed to syphilis and the return of Christopher Columbus and his crew from their first New World voyage. Thus, the presence of the yaws genome in a medieval grave suggests questions still exist about the origin of syphilis in Europe, she explained. "

Among the artifacts in the tomb, researchers found a bronze helmet, a bronze basin, swords made of iron and jade, and a bronze pot with a long, swan-shaped neck that contained about 100 ounces of liquid. The realistic sculpture is thought to have been modeled after a live swan. “We can boldly estimate that swans may have appeared in Sanmenxia during the late Qin and early Han dynasties,” Zhu said. The yellow-brown liquid found within the pot will be analyzed. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/9046-200924-spain-shakespeare-play,Medieval,"17th-Century English Book Found in College Library in Spain. MADRID, SPAIN— BBC News reports that John Stone of the University of Barcelona has found a 1634 printing of The Two Noble Kinsmen , a play written by William Shakespeare with John Fletcher, a house playwright for the theater group the King’s Men. The play appears in a book of English plays held at the Royal Scots College, which is now located in Salamanca, Spain. In the seventeenth century, the college was located in Madrid, and was a rare source of English literature for Spanish intellectuals. “By the 1630s English plays were increasingly associated with elite culture,” Stone explained. Based on Geoffrey Chaucer’s fourteenth-century poem The Knight’s Tale , Two Noble Kinsmen was written around 1613 or 1614, and is thought to have been one of Shakespeare’s last works before he died in 1616. “It is likely these plays arrived as part of some student’s personal library or at the request of the rector of the Royal Scots College, Hugh Semple, who was friends with the Spanish playwright Lope de Vega and had more plays in his personal library,” Stone said. The book remains in its original leather binding, he added. "

MEXICO CITY, MEXICO—The Associated Press reports that hearths, smoke marks, firewood, stacked mining debris, pieces of broken stalagmites, stone tools, navigational aids, and digging sites have been found in flooded caves in the Yucatan peninsula. The remains of nine individuals dating back some 13,000 years have also been found in the caves, which flooded some 8,000 years ago. The artifacts suggest that people entered the cave system to mine tons of iron-rich red ochre, which was used in decorations and rituals. “Now we know that ancient humans did not risk entering this maze of caves just to get water or flee from predators, but that they also entered them to mine,” explained Roberto Junco Sánchez of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History.

ITHACA, NEW YORK—According to a statement released by PLOS Genetics , Melissa Hubisz and Amy Williams of Cornell University and Adam Siepel of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory developed an algorithm to identify tiny segments of DNA from other species in genomes. When they analyzed ancient genomes belonging to two Neanderthals, a Denisovan, and two modern people from Africa, the researchers found evidence that three percent of the Neanderthal genome came from interbreeding with ancient humans some 200,000 to 300,000 years ago. About one percent of the Denisovan genome is thought to have come from an unidentified relative that may have been Homo erectus . About 15 percent of this genetic material may have been passed on to today’s modern humans. The researchers conclude that groups of ancient humans are likely to have mixed more frequently than previously thought. "

AARHUS, DENMARK—According to a statement released by Aarhus University , scientists from the Danish National Research Foundation, Aarhus University, and the University of Münster have developed a technique to distinguish between clear glass manufactured in Egypt and in the Levant during the Roman period. Although clear glass was known in fourth-century A.D. Rome as “Alexandrian” glass, archaeologists have not found furnaces for clear glass production in Egypt. Such furnaces have, however, been found in the Levant. The new technique measures the isotopes of the rare element hafnium in the glass, which can then be matched to the sands used to make the glass, said Gry Barfod of Aarhus University. The study indicates that so-called Alexandrian glass was indeed made in Egypt. Sand from the Nile, the researchers explained, contained lime to keep the high-quality glass stable. Antimony was added to make it crystal clear. Meanwhile, in the Levant, manganese was added to the mix to produce transparent glass. "

Alberto Canto of the Autonomous University of Madrid said that the gate is thought to mark the eastern entrance to the palace parade ground at the ruins of the royal city of Medina Azahara. As many as 20,000 people were once part of the lavish palace household, which included a zoo, an aviary, four fish ponds, 300 baths, weapons factories, and barracks for the soldiers of the royal guard. The palace was destroyed in A.D. 1010 during a civil war. “Everything collapsed and so we found buried the remains of its tiles, wood, nails, beams, hinges, and ornaments,” Canto said. "

The fossils in the study include the two-million-year-old remains of a Homo erectus child, making them 100,000 to 200,000 years older than any other known Homo erectus fossils, according to Andy Herries of La Trobe University. “Until this find, we always assumed Homo erectus originated from eastern Africa,” explained Stephanie Baker of the University of Johannesburg. “That would mean that they later moved northwards into East Africa. From there they went through North Africa to populate the rest of the world,” she added. The study also indicates that two other types of humans, Paranthropus and Australopithecus , shared the landscape with Homo erectus . "

COVENTRY, ENGLAND—According to a statement released by the University of Warwick , scientists from the University of Warwick and the University of Ghent employed X-ray technology to examine tiny brass links recovered from the wreckage of Mary Rose , which is thought to be the favored warship of Henry VIII. The ship sank in the Solent during a battle with the French in 1545, and was raised, along with some 19,000 artifacts, in 1982. The brass links in the new study are thought to have come from a suit of chain mail armor. The analysis revealed the links were made of an alloy composed of 73 percent copper and 27 percent zinc, with traces of lead and gold on their surfaces. Mark Dowsett of the University of Warwick said the traces of heavy metals may have been picked up during the production process from tools that were used to work gold and lead. The lead may also have come from dust from the firing of Tudor-era pistols loaded with lead balls, or it may have been introduced to the Solent through pollution or the bombing of the Portsmouth Dockyard during World War II, he surmised.

The structure, built in 1856, was spotted with ground-penetrating radar earlier this year. Archaeologist Jack Gary of Colonial Williamsburg said the excavation has also uncovered the foundations of a smaller building at the site and a posthole that could date to the late eighteenth century. “What’s exciting about that is that there’s intact stuff out here that hasn’t been completely disturbed by other activity,” he said. It is not clear yet if the earlier foundation could be from the congregation’s first Meeting House, which was constructed in 1818. “It is possible they are connected, but more extensive excavation will be needed to make that determination,” Gary explained. Pieces of ceramic, glass, bricks, and nails have also been recovered. "

NEWCASTLE, ENGLAND—According to a statement released by Newcastle University , Eric Tourigny examined more than 1,000 animal headstones in pet cemeteries in Newcastle and London in order to study changing attitudes toward pets over a period of 100 years, beginning in 1881, when the first public pet cemetery opened in London. Tourigny found that throughout the study period, mourners compared death to sleep. Yet in the Victorian era, headstone inscriptions referred to pets as companions and friends, while more recent inscriptions called the buried pets family members and expressed the hope that the animals would be reunited with their owners more frequently. After World War II, references to animals as family members rose, a change that coincided with the increase in the use of family surnames on pet gravestones. Some of the earlier references put the surname in parentheses or quotation marks. Tourigny suggests this reluctance to acknowledge pets as full members of the family may reflect a conflict between personal feelings and societal norms. "

The statue fragment features flowing locks and headgear featuring raised bits suggestive of jewels. Richards thinks the statue may date to the 1340s and represent Edward II, who relinquished the crown to his son in 1327. “It could be a stylized image of a Saxon king, possibly even Alfred,” Richards added. “The quality of the carving is absolutely stunning. You can even see the eyelids.” The head is thought to have been part of a gallery of statues of monarchs that would have screened the nuns from other worshippers. Although much of the abbey’s stone was hauled away as building material by local people in the sixteenth century, Richards explained, the head would have been useless to them. "

The hunter-gatherers are thought to have acquired these animals from farmers who lived on the coast shortly after their arrival in the first millennium A.D. As a student at the University of Bristol, Helen Fewlass, now of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, analyzed residues on pottery recovered from the sites of Sehonghong and Likoaeng, which were found with pieces of iron and what are thought to be domestic animal bones. The analysis detected dairy residues in about one-third of the hunter-gatherer pots, Fewlass said. One residue from Likoaeng was dated to between A.D. 579 and 654, while the sample from Sehonghong was dated to between A.D. 885 and 990. Fewlass then compared the hunter-gatherer residues with those on pots unearthed at a nearby agricultural settlement. The results suggest that the hunter-gatherer groups learned animal husbandry techniques from the farmers and had ongoing contact with them, she explained. "

The pit was located in an area with burnt floors and a thick layer of ash. Rey and Greenfield said the possible cultic area resembles religious festivals described in cuneiform texts unearthed at Girsu in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. According to those texts, the Mesopotamian warrior god Ningirsu was honored twice a year with feasting and processions that lasted for three or four days. Rey and Greenfield suggest the ash at the site was the result of large ritual fires, and the ceramic items may have been used for feasting before they were discarded in the pit.

Archaeologist David Staley said State Route 5S essentially follows the path of the section of the old canal under investigation. The excavation team, he explained, has recovered early twentieth-century artifacts tossed into this part of the canal when it was filled in 1922, in addition to the walls and bridges that once spanned it. “What we’ve noticed is that the construction style for the walls varies both in terms of how well it was made originally and how it was maintained and rebuilt through the years,” Staley said. For example, the quality of stonework in the canal walls was better when they intersected busy streets. The team has also found evidence of lift bridges, which remain parallel to the deck as they rise, and a single-leaf trunnion bascule bridge, a type of drawbridge that swings upward to allow boats to pass.

In a history of Egypt written in the early third century B.C. by a Ptolemaic priest named Manetho, the Hyksos were described as invaders from the northeast who swept into Egypt during a time of turmoil. Hyksos architecture, artifacts, and burials resemble those found in the Near East, explained Chris Stantis of Bournemouth University. The study revealed, however, that 36 of the 75 people tested had lived in Egypt before the Hyksos came to power in 1638 B.C. The study also suggests that those who grew up somewhere other than Egypt probably came from a variety of places, and 30 of the immigrants were found to be female, Stantis added. “We need to look more into who these women were and why they moved, but the fact that there’s more women than men changes a lot of interpretations,” Stantis said.

LEIPZIG, GERMANY—A new study of three Neanderthal genomes has found that they each carried three mutations on one gene on both sets of chromosomes that may have made the individuals predisposed to a heightened sense of pain, according to a Nature News report. Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology explained that while very rare in modern humans, the mutations, which are involved in altering the shape of a protein that carries painful sensations to the spinal cord and brain, may have been common in Neanderthals. Pääbo and his colleagues then looked for evidence of the Neanderthal mutation in a British database of modern genomes. None of the database participants had two copies of the mutated gene, as the Neanderthals did, but those who had one copy were about seven percent more likely to report having pain than people without the mutation. The researchers note that how the signal was processed in the spinal cord and brain would have also contributed to how Neanderthals experienced pain. Further study of additional Neanderthal genomes will investigate if the mutation might have been a beneficial adaptation. "

DUBLIN, IRELAND—According to a report in The Independent , Bernard Meehan of Trinity College, Dublin, has examined the Book of Kells , a 1,200-year-old illustrated copy of the four Christian Gospels, and offered new thoughts on its production. He thinks work on the four sections may not have begun at the same time, in Scotland, as had been previously thought. He says the handwriting of St. John’s Gospel, which was copied on the Scottish island of Iona, indicates it was made by a traditional scribe educated during the mid-eighth century. The book, traditionally the last of the four Christian Gospels, may have been intended to stand alone, since it was especially revered by medieval Celtic Christians. The same scribe’s handwriting has also been detected in the opening pages of St. Mark’s Gospel, however, suggesting that he may have died before completing that project. Meehan suggests a series of Viking attacks on the Scottish monastery, and possibly an epidemic, delayed production of the rest of the volume by about 50 years. Then, he believes, the remaining pages of St. Mark’s Gospel, and the entire texts of St. Luke’s Gospel and St. Matthew’s Gospel, were produced in Ireland, after the monks had moved to the safer, inland site at Kells.

The study revealed the beginnings of dental decay that went undetected when the bones were unearthed in the 1960s. “Traces of caries are preserved on molars, rich in furrows and depressions, with an irregular surface. It is obviously difficult to speculate whether tooth decay would develop further if the owners of the teeth had lived longer,” Tomczyk said. It had been previously thought that dental caries developed in people living in the region some 7,000 years ago, when people began farming and eating more grains. Berries, other fruits, and honey may have contributed to dental problems in people who lived during the Mesolithic, Tomczyk explained. "

The chemical composition and structures of the teeth and their roots allowed the scientists to determine how old each animal was at the time of death, where it was born, and what time of year it had died. The study revealed that at least four of the foxes had migrated long distances, and at least ten of them had been killed between late winter and late spring. Pryor explained that Ice Age hunters likely timed their fox hunts to take advantage of the animals’ thick fur coats and body fat in late winter, and used Kraków Spadizista as a temporary base camp while maintaining trapping lines and processing hides during the hunting season.

GLASGOW, SCOTLAND—According to a report in The Scotsman , Ewan Campbell of Glasgow University suggests that the island of Iona was not abandoned for the period between A.D. 806, when 68 monks were killed during a Viking raid, and the construction of a Benedictine abbey in the twelfth century, as had been previously thought. Recent archaeological investigations on the island’s eastern coast have uncovered copper alloy pins dated to the tenth and eleventh centuries that would have been used to fasten tunics and cloaks. He thinks the Iona community established a metalworking center after the massacre. “The nicest pin is a copy of one that was made in Viking Dublin but it looks to me that it was made on Iona given the differences in manufacturing,” Campbell said. Gravestones, a hoard of coins, a stone cross, and other religious items dated to the tenth and eleventh centuries have also been found on the island, he added. “Iona was important as one of the places where the Norse were coming into contact with Christianity and converted to Christianity,” he said.

MEXICO CITY, MEXICO— Mexico News Daily reports that a team of researchers including Luis Alberto Martos López of Mexico’s National Autonomous University have dated charcoal samples collected from the remains of 14 ancient bonfires in a flooded cave in the Yucatán Peninsula to some 10,000 years ago. The hunter-gatherers who built the fires would have used an entrance hidden by a mound of rocks, and traveled along a narrow, 50-foot-long tunnel to reach the cave, which measures about 215 feet square, and about 15 to 20 feet in height. Now known as the Aktun Ha cenote, the cave, which was well ventilated and equipped with a natural well before it flooded, probably provided hunter-gatherers with temporary shelter. The fires are likely to have been lit for warmth and cooking. Stone tools were also recovered from the cave. "

RYE, AUSTRALIA—According to a statement from Flinders University , an international team of researchers investigated the wreck of the Barbara , which sank near the coast of southeastern Australia in 1853. The Barbara was constructed in Tasmania in 1841 to carry lime for brickmaking, which was an early industry practiced in southern Australia. Analysis of wood samples revealed the ship was built from timbers grown in Victoria, New South Wales, Northern Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmanian blue gum, a type of eucalyptus tree. “This is possibly the first time such a wide variety of timbers have been found in an Australian built vessel,” said Wendy Van Duivenvoorde of Flinders University. “It indicates that early shipbuilders had developed a detailed knowledge of the properties of indigenous timbers appropriate for shipbuilding.” Analysis of metal and fiber samples taken from the wreck is still underway, she added.

The tomb, which is surrounded by a total of three moats and two dikes, is thought to have been built in the mid-fifth century A.D. for Emperor Nintoku. Little is known about the structure, however, because in the past access to it has been limited by Japan’s Imperial Household Agency. Scholars think the mound itself was covered with some 50 million stones. The discovery of paving on the inner dike, which covers an area of about 78,000 square yards, increases the estimated amount of labor that was required to build the tomb complex. “This is overwhelmingly unique,” commented archaeologist Kazuo Ichinose of Kyoto Tachibana University.

Archaeologist Johny Isla explained that this geoglyph had grown faint due to the natural effects of erosion on the hillside’s steep slope. The image has been cleaned and conserved, and dated stylistically to the Paracas era, between 500 B.C. and A.D. 200, making it older than the animal and geometric images created by the Nazca culture between A.D. 200 and 700. The use of drones has led to the discovery of between 80 and 100 Paracas geoglyphs on hillsides that were not visible in previous aerial photographs, Isla added. Textiles from this period also feature images of birds, cats, and people in a similar style to that of the Paracas-era geoglyphs. “It’s quite striking that we’re still finding new figures, but we also know that there are more to be found,” he concluded.

WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA— The Virginia Gazette reports that Colonial Williamsburg archaeologists working under the guidance of members of First Baptist Church have detected the possible foundations of the church's original building with ground-penetrating radar. The congregation was founded in 1776 by free and enslaved African Americans, who first met in secret at Green Spring Plantation, then in a rural area outside Williamsburg, and then in a structure offered by a white admirer within what is now Colonial Williamsburg’s historic area. That structure was destroyed in 1834 by a tornado, and replaced in 1856 by a brick building known as the African Baptist Church. That edifice was torn down and the congregation moved to another location in 1956, when the property was purchased by Colonial Williamsburg. Archaeological investigations in 1957 uncovered historic foundations. The researchers will now look for additional information about the structures to create an interpretive program at the site. Members of the current First Baptist congregation will be consulted about how any recovered artifacts will be preserved and displayed, and about how any burials found on the property can be protected and memorialized.

The pieces, which resemble those made by the Scythians, who lived to the north, had been wrapped in leaves and placed in a leather bag. “This secured deposit had been buried on a sandy hill near the bank of the Vistula,” said Jacek Gackowski of the Nicolaus Copernicus University. “It can be assumed that someone who hid these valuable items planned their subsequent extraction.” The only thing missing from the bridle is the bit, the piece that rests in the horse’s mouth, he added. The leather bag also contained a locally made ax. Gackowski thinks the person who buried the bridle and the ax may have intended to melt them down. “Samples will be taken and their analysis will allow, among other things, to determine the exact time when the treasure was buried,” he said.

During World War II, German death squads carried out at least two mass killings at the site, Kobiałka said. In 1945, near the end of the war, an estimated 600 people, thought to have been members of the Polish resistance and Gestapo prisoners from the prison in Bydgoszcz, were shot and killed at the site. “According to historical records, the crime was committed by the Gestapo and members of the German police,” Kobiałka said. “The bullets and shells came from the Walther PPK and P08 Parabellum pistols, suggesting the victims were executed at close range.” The remains were then burned with gasoline-fueled fires, turning most of the bones to ash. “The gasoline barrels that still lie in Death Valley confirm it,” he said.

SEVILLE, SPAIN—According to a report in Cosmos Magazine , archaeologists led by Marta Cintas-Peña and Leonardo García Sanjuán of the University of Seville reviewed more than 500 Neolithic burials at 21 archaeological sites on the Iberian Peninsula. They found that at the 198 graves where the sex of the deceased could be determined, there were 1.5 male graves for every female grave. The researchers said that children’s graves were also underrepresented in the sample. “The quantity of males cannot be natural,” Cintas-Peña said. The study indicates that men were more likely to be buried with arrowheads and other projectiles, and more likely to have signs of injury or violent death, while women were more likely to be buried with ceramics. However, the researchers added, the most elaborate graves in the cemeteries did not necessarily belong to men. They suggest gender differences, and male predominance in terms of violence, arose along with social inequalities as people accumulated private property. “If we can say that gender inequality began in the Neolithic, or in the Copper Age or in any period, it means that it's something cultural, it’s not something biologically determined,” Cintas-Peña explained.

CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA—According to a report in The Post and Courier , archaeologist Mike Yianopoulos of the South Carolina Battleground Preservation Trust and his colleagues have pinpointed the site of the Battle of Tar Bluff, fought in August of 1782. The battle is remembered today as the place where John Laurens, an aide-de-camp to George Washington, and friend of Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette, was killed. Laurens, 140 infantrymen, and artillery soldiers equipped with a howitzer attempted to secure a section of the Combahee River in order to prevent British soldiers stationed in Charles Towne from looting nearby farms. But the British learned of the plan and ambushed the Americans. General Mordecai Gist and his reinforcements were too late to save Laurens, but they caught up with the British, leading to a draw between the two sides. Yianopoulos and his team members used GPS technology and metal detectors to map the locations of dropped and fired musket balls and other artifacts, including an Irish halfpenny dated to 1775, a bayonet, and British grapeshot. They then compared this information to a map of the battle drawn by a British officer, and a lidar image of the surface of the ground, which revealed the locations of two small creeks recorded on the map. The battlefield, which is located on private property, is one of 72 identified by the Trust. "

OXFORD, ENGLAND—An international team of researchers including Teresa Fernández-Crespo of the University of Oxford and Javier Ordoño of France’s National Center for Scientific Research has analyzed human remains recovered during previous excavations at La Hoya, the site of an Iron Age village in northern Spain, according to a Live Science report. The charred, dismembered remains, dated to the mid-fourth to late third century B.C., place the attack before the Roman invasion in 218 B.C. No weapons were found near the more than one dozen unburied skeletons of both men and women, which showed no signs of defensive injuries. The presence of jewelry, hobbled livestock, craft items, and vessels full of grain suggests the surprise attack occurred on a market day in the summer or early autumn. Because the marauders left these goods behind, the researchers think the attack was politically motivated, rather than a raid for economic gain. The unburied remains also suggest that the village was then abandoned. "

LONDON, ENGLAND— The Guardian reports that Richard Evershed of the University of Bristol and his colleagues have developed a technique to isolate fatty acids from food residues in pottery for precise radiocarbon dating. Evershed explained that the method has been shown to produce dates accurate to within the span of a human life by comparing the dates obtained from fatty acids with dates obtained from charcoal, seeds, and bones, at sites in Britain, Europe, and Africa. For example, the team recently dated pottery fragments recovered in London’s East End to 5,600 years ago. The pots, which were decorated with fingertip and deer hoof impressions, once held dairy products like butter and cheese made from the milk of cattle and sheep or goats, and stewed beef and mutton. Such Neolithic artifacts rarely survive in the city, explained Jon Cotton of the Museum of London Archaeology, and in this case, no other organic materials for radiocarbon dating were recovered from the site.

The ration included a can of Coca-Cola, chewing gum, and a can of stewed beef and vegetables. Susumu Kokubun, a member of the 1965 expedition of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, said his team leader, Masayoshi Murayama, traveled to the area near Mukai Rocks, where the food was found, in January 1966 in a helicopter that had been loaded on their icebreaker, The Fuji . “He may have left the food on that occasion,” Kokubun said. An official from the Coca-Cola Company in Japan said this particular Coca-Cola can design was the first one introduced to Japan, and was available for only one or two years. It is labeled in katakana and had to be opened with a can opener. The best-selling chewing gum, first released in 1960, was developed for explorers to Antarctica by the Lotte Company in a “Cool Mint” flavor fortified with vitamins and minerals. Its packaging featured a penguin design. “I feel a special connection with the discovery because I was born in 1965,” said current expedition member Noriaki Obara, who discovered the emergency rations.

The group of volunteer divers had been planning to document shipwrecks dated to the First and Second World Wars at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland when they spotted the wreckage of the Dutch three-masted ship. The shape of its hull and its lack of guns indicate the vessel was a fluyt, designed by the Dutch to carry twice the cargo of other ships. When combined with a pulley and tackle system for the rigging, the fluyt could be managed by a smaller crew in order to increase the trader’s profits. The diving team reports that although the holds of the ship are intact, a trawl appears to have caused some damage. Maritime archaeologist Niklas Eriksson of the University of Stockholm added that the shape of the ship’s stern is unique, which may indicate that it was an early version of the fluyt.

Team member Ainara Sistiaga of MIT and the University of Copenhagen was looking for traces of leaf waxes in 1.7 million-year-old sediments found near stone tools and animal bones at a site in Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge in order to study the ancient climate when she found lipids similar to those produced by bacteria living in the very hot springs at Yellowstone National Park. Sistiaga said the tectonic activity in the Great Rift Valley could have brought boiling groundwater to the surface. And, she explained, if an animal fell into the water and cooked, the early humans may have eaten it, although Sistiaga noted that detecting direct evidence of such behavior will be difficult. The team members will look for evidence of hot springs at other early human archaeological sites. "

The remains were found facing north in a kneeling position with hands crossed in front, suggesting that the person had been beheaded as a human sacrifice. Oracle bones bearing glyphs describing such a practice have been found at the Yin Ruins, the capital of the Shang Dynasty. At Chaizhuang, the researchers found an oracle bone bearing the “Kan” glyph, which is associated with sacrificing people and livestock in pits and upright burials. Houses, wells, stoves, roads, pottery, bones, jewelry, and tombs have also been uncovered at the site. "

VERONA, NEW YORK—According to a Rome Sentinel report, bone fragments held in the archives at Colgate University's Longyear Museum of Anthropology will be handed over to the Oneida Indian Nation. The ten fragments, identified during a recent inventory, are thought to be the remains of at least six different people. The bones were unearthed in the twentieth century by members of the New York State Archaeological Association at various sites in the ancestral Oneida homelands, and were acquired by the museum between 1959 and 2000. “We are grateful for the return of these remains, and truly appreciate Colgate University for coming forward with this discovery so that our ancestors may receive a proper re-internment at our burial grounds,” said Ray Halbritter, Oneida Indian Nation Representative. The Longyear Museum repatriated additional items to the Oneida Nation in 1995 and 2003. "

BOURGAS, BULGARIA— The Sofia Globe reports that more than 40 coins have been unearthed at the Aquae Calidae spa complex, which is located at a hot mineral spring site in southern Bulgaria, near the coast of the Black Sea. Use of the springs dates back to the Neolithic period. Most of the newly discovered coins date to the fourth century A.D., according to archaeologist Dimcho Momchilov, who has also uncovered remnants of the Roman-period bath at the six-acre site. “Our desire is to explore the shaft we found east of the building,” Momchilov said. “It is from an early period and is very interesting. There are partially preserved water pipes and we will try to open it this year.” Ruins of structures built during the Byzantine, medieval, and Ottoman periods have also been found. "

CARDIFF, WALES— The Guardian reports that analysis of cooking pot residues and animal bones recovered from archaeological sites in England suggests that the consumption of pork and chicken increased after the Norman Conquest in A.D. 1066, while cabbage remained a diet staple. Before the arrival of the Normans, beef, lamb, mutton, and goat had been more widely consumed. Researchers also found a change in the chemical composition of the pig bones over time. Before the conquest, pigs were likely allowed to forage the countryside, but after the invasion, the animals were fed more protein, suggesting that farming practices intensified and pigs were kept in sties and fed scraps. The chemical composition of the bones of 36 men and women who lived between the tenth and thirteenth centuries indicates that they consumed about the same amount of protein and carbohydrate before and after the invasion, although there was a short period of dietary stress for a few years after 1066. Rickets, scurvy, and other bone conditions brought about by poor diet were rare, however, the researchers added. "

KFAR KAMA, ISRAEL— Haaretz reports that a 1,300-year-old Byzantine church, which appears to have once been part of a larger monastery complex, has been uncovered in Israel's Galilee region. Working ahead of construction on a playground in the village of Kfar Kama, which is home to a large Circassian community, archaeologists discovered the roughly 40-by-120-foot footprint of the church. The structure featured a large courtyard, a foyer and central hall, three apses, and ornate mosaic floors. The decoration of the mosaics includes geometric, as well as blue, black, and red floral patterns. The team also discovered a small stone box, which researchers believe was used as a reliquary. Ground-penetrating radar surveys revealed the presence of two additional rooms at the site that have yet to be excavated. A smaller church from the same period was previously excavated in Kfar Kama in the early 1960s. “This was probably the village church,"" said archaeologist Moti Aviam of Kinneret Institute of Galilean Archaeology at the Kinneret Academic College, ""whilst the church now discovered was probably part of a contemporary monastery on the outskirts of the village ."" Aviam and his colleagues believe the presence of the churches and the monastery suggest that the village was an important Christian center during the Byzantine period. "

LEIPZIG, GERMANY—According to a statement released by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , Andrea Picin and an international team of researchers analyzed the genome of a worn Neanderthal tooth recovered from Poland’s Stajnia Cave. The researchers determined with the molecular genetic clock that the individual lived at least 80,000 years ago, and found its mitochondrial DNA resembled that of a Neanderthal whose remains were found in the Caucasus. Based on stone tool evidence from this period, Neanderthals are thought to have hunted migratory animals across the frigid Northern and Eastern European Plains. Some may have even traveled along the Prut and Dniester Rivers into the Caucasus, the researchers explained. Previous genetic studies of Neanderthal remains have indicated that Neanderthals from Western Europe replaced the population of Neanderthals living in the Altai Mountains some 90,000 years ago, and then about 45,000 years ago, western European Neanderthals replaced local Neanderthals in the Caucasus. The researchers said the new study helps explain the timeline for the wide distribution of Neanderthal artifacts found between eastern France, Poland, and the Caucasus. "

Soldiers stationed at the site left behind coins, musket balls, a thimble, a fine-toothed bone comb, a clay curler, clay pipes, glassware, military buttons, and uniform buckles. Zooarchaeologist Siobhan Duffy also identified a rooster’s lower leg bone whose spur had been sawn off. “This procedure would have been carried out during the bird’s life, to facilitate the attachment of an artificial spur for the purposes of cockfighting,” she said. The artifacts suggest that senior officers who wore curled wigs and drank from fine glassware participated in the sport of cockfighting. "

KHAKASSIA, RUSSIA— Sci News reports that Yury Esin of the Khakassian Research Institute for Language, Literature and History and his colleagues have conducted a new study of an engraved mammoth tusk recovered in western Siberia’s Tom River in 1988. The tusk, which measures nearly 28 inches long and is thought to have come from a male mammoth between 35 and 40 years of age, has been radiocarbon dated to 13,000 years ago. Esin said the lines engraved on the tusk are thin and shallow, making them difficult to decipher. “They are on the surface of a round, long, curved and heavy object which does not allow all the imagery to be seen and recognized without rotating the tusk,” Esin said. After making a 2-D model of the tusk, the researchers were able to make out images of two pairs of two-humped camels. Each camel is shown with only two legs and patches of thick fur. Single dots on two of the figures are thought to represent eyes. Esin said the researchers also spotted two legs among the lines that may be part of an anthropomorphic figure. “The comparative analysis of the stylistic features of the camel figures shows that they correspond to the age of the tusk itself, making them, at present, the oldest camel images in Asia,” he added.

M. Maruthu Pandiyan of the Madurai Government Museum said the style of the sculpture corresponds to the Pandya dynasty, a Tamil-speaking group that ruled in south India and Sri Lanka as early as the fourth century B.C. In the sculpture, Lord Vishnu is depicted with four arms. Two of them are held vertically, while the other two hold a broken disc-like weapon called a chakra and a conch shell. “The chakra and the conch are the main features of the Pandya period,” Pandiyan said. Lord Vishnu is also shown wearing a necklace of large gemstones, he added. "

WARSAW, POLAND— Science in Poland reports that a nineteenth-century sword bearing the remnants of a Polish inscription has been unearthed in northern Bulgaria, near the historic capital of Veliko Tarnovo, which is located on the Yantra River. The inscription, “Vivat Szlachcic Pan I fundator wojska,” translates to “Long live the Noble Lord and founder of the army.” Archaeologist Piotr Dyczek of the University of Warsaw said this phrase was usually followed by the phrase, “Long live the will and the common good.” Polish swords from the period were normally engraved on both sides with inscriptions and patriotic motifs, he added. “The sabre was probably the spoils of an officer of the Tsarist army who participated in the suppression of the January Uprising in 1863 and 1864, who then fitted it with a silver hilt typical for a shashka—a sabre with an open hilt with a split pommel,” Dyczek surmised. This officer might have then lost the weapon in Bulgaria while fighting in the Russo-Turkish War, between 1877 and 1878, he added. "

JENA, GERMANY—According to a statement released by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History , an international team of researchers analyzed satellite imagery and conducted field surveys to document hundreds of massive rectangular stone structures in northwestern Saudi Arabia, and discover more than one hundred additional structures. Known as “mustatils,” the rectangular monuments are thought to have been constructed by pastoralists for ritual use. Most of them consist of two large platforms connected by long, low, parallel walls, and some locations have multiple structures built right next to each other. Few artifacts have been found at the mustatils. Bones of wild animals and what may have been wild aurochs or early domesticated cattle were found inside one of the platforms. Charcoal from this site has been dated to 7,000 years ago, when the region was covered with grasses, dotted with lakes, and vulnerable to drought. Researcher Huw Groucutt explained that the very act of building mustatils probably helped to bond pastoralists living in such a challenging environment. "

STÖÐVARFJÖRÐUR, ICELAND— Live Science reports that traces of a longhouse dated to the early ninth century A.D. have been found in eastern Iceland, under the remains of another Viking structure thought to have served as a chieftain’s house decades later in the late ninth century, based upon the decorative beads, pieces of silver, and Roman and Middle Eastern coins recovered there. It had been previously thought that Vikings escaping the Norwegian king Harald Fairhair first came to the island in A.D. 874. Researchers led by archaeologist Bjarni Einarsson think the older building may have been used as a summer settlement by workers who were fishing and trapping whales, seals, and birds. Traces of a metalworking shop were also uncovered in the hall’s westernmost end. He added that the seasonal camp in Iceland resembles the Viking site discovered in Newfoundland at L’Anse aux Meadows, which has been dated to A.D. 1000. “This was a pattern of the settlement of the islands in the Atlantic Ocean,” Einarsson said. “First, we had the seasonal camps, and then the settlement followed.” "

NOVOSIBIRSK, RUSSIA—Drills, cutters, and leveling blades were employed more than 20,000 years ago to carve the mammoth-ivory figurines and beads recovered from south-central Siberia’s Ust-Kova site, according to a statement released by Siberian Federal University . L.V. Lbova of Novosibirsk State University and Nikolay Drozdov of Siberian Federal University and their colleagues studied markings on the figurines and jewelry under a microscope in order to identify the tools that had been used to shape them. They then used those tools to recreate the objects and the markings. Chemical analysis of the ancient carvings indicates that the sculptures were painted with manganese and magnesium that was probably extracted from salt rocks located near the archaeological site. A figurine depicting a mammoth, for example, had been painted red on one side and black on the other. Layers of pigment on the beads suggest they were regularly repainted over many years. The researchers think that tool use studies could help them to identify the styles of individual master carvers, while a comparison of carving techniques between different archaeological sites in the region could offer information about relationships between the groups who once lived there.

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND— Cosmos Magazine reports that researchers from the University of Cambridge and Ghent University mapped the remnants of the ancient city of Falerii Novi with advanced ground-penetrating radar towed behind a quad bicycle. Founded in 241 B.C. and occupied until about A.D. 700, the walled city was located some 30 miles north of Rome and covered about 75 acres. By mapping the site at different depths, the researchers were able to see how the city evolved over time. In particular, the survey revealed a large rectangular building connected to water pipes that ran under city blocks to an aqueduct. This structure is thought to have served as an open-air pool in a public bathing complex. The researchers also detected a possible public monument made up of two large structures facing each other within a porticus duplex, a covered passageway with a central row of columns. Martin Millett of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues noted that the public buildings they detected in Falerii Novi were more elaborate, and the city’s layout was less standardized, than expected, based upon previous studies of other small Roman cities.

BURGOS, SPAIN—According to a statement released by Spain’s National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH) , scientists have used electron spin resonance (ESR), luminescence, and paleomagnetism to obtain new dates for two Lower Paleolithic sites in France. Team leader Mathieu Duval said previous research had only used one method to date the sites. The site of Lunery-la Terre-des-Sablons had been dated to about 1.1 million years old, but the new study suggests tools found there were made about 710,000 years ago. These Oldowan tools are similar in style to those found in Spain at Atapuerca Gran Dolina, Sima del Elefante, and Barranco León, and Duente Nueva-3. The Acheulean tools at Brinay-la Noira were dated to about 650,000 years ago, in agreement with previous studies of the site. Team member Josep M.

The researchers suggest the image resembles a dancing shaman, or perhaps a person dressed as an animal, or even a lizard, and that Natufian burial rites may have been more complex than previously thought. The stone, which was carried up a cliff and into the cave, was found covering the remains of several people who died between 14,000 and 12,000 years ago. In all, some 30 burials and ten slabs of rock have been found in the cave. Rosenberg said the other stones may have been painted or decorated in a way that has not survived. Previous studies of Natufian burials from Raqefet Cave have uncovered evidence that the graves were lined with plants. Grave goods such as meat, stone tools, and mortars have also been recovered, in addition to artifacts related to the brewing of alcoholic beverages.

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL—According to a Haaretz report, an international team of researchers led by Ella Assaf of Tel Aviv University suggests that stone spheres unearthed in central Israel’s Qesem Cave were used to break up large animal bones in order to extract their nutritious, high-calorie marrow. Examination of the artifacts also indicates the cave’s residents may have collected the spheres from an older site and reused them, since such spheroids found in the Middle East usually date to between 1.4 million and 500,000 years ago, and Qesem Cave was inhabited between 400,000 and 200,000 years ago. These stone balls were made of dolomite or limestone, which is not found in the area, and they were covered with a different patina than other tools found in the cave, Assaf explained, which suggests the spheres were stored in another environment over a long period of time. Microscopic analysis of the artifacts revealed wear and tear on their ridges, as well as residues of fat, collagen, and bone. The team members recreated the spheres, and used the new tools to break open fresh animal bones. And although the experiment reproduced the marks found on the prehistoric tools, they were tricky to make. “One little mistake and the sphere can break in half, or you can keep fixing the ridges and end up with a very tiny, useless ball,” Assaf said. Recycling the ancient tools was therefore worthwhile, she said. "

It had been previously thought that the monkeys were guenons, which are local to the region, until zooarchaeologist Marta Osypińska of the Polish Academy of Sciences and her colleagues used 3-D scans of the bones to compare them with those of other species. “This is a unique finding,” Osypińska said. “Until now, no one has found Indian monkeys in the archaeological sites in Africa. Interestingly, even ancient written sources don’t mention this practice.” After surviving the weeks-long journey across the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, she added, the rhesus macaques died young, probably because the diet they were fed in Berenice lacked necessary nutrients. All of the rhesus macaques in the cemetery were arranged in their graves as if they were sleeping. One had been covered with woolen fabric. Shells from the Indian Ocean, amphora fragments, a piglet skeleton, and three kitten skeletons were also recovered from the monkey burials. "

The analysis indicates that the remains, which had been estimated to be 500,000 years old, are only between 274,000 and 324,000 years old. Grün said the new timeline for Homo heidelbergensis challenges the idea that all stone tools dating to Africa’s Middle Stone Age were crafted by modern humans. Additionally, Chris Stringer of London’s Natural History Museum, where the skull has been housed, explained that the new dates suggest Homo heidelbergensis could have lived in Central Africa at the same time that the more primitive species Homo naledi lived in Southern Africa, and early modern humans lived in what are now Morocco and Ethiopia.

TRONDHEIM, NORWAY—According to a statement released by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), archaeologist Astrid Kviseth and her colleagues have discovered an ax, spear, shield, and sword in a 1,100-year-old grave in a burial ground near a Viking-era farm in central Norway. The grave partially overlapped three others placed in a ditch surrounding a large burial mound at the site. Archaeologist Raymond Sauvage of the NTNU University Museum said landowning farmers were required by law to own such weapons. But in most graves from the period, the sword is found on the right side of the body, even though a right-handed person would have worn a sword fastened to the left side of the body, in order to withdraw it from its scabbard with the right hand. “Why the swords are almost always placed on the right side is a bit mysterious,” Sauvage said. “One theory is that the underworlds you go to after death are the mirror image of the upper world.” In this burial, the sword was found on the left side of the body. “Maybe he was left-handed, and they took that into account for the afterlife?” Sauvage mused. The team members will X-ray the corroded sword to look for any ornamentation or pattern welding on its blade. "

TRNAVA, SLOVAKIA— The Slovak Spectator reports that a cache of medieval coins was discovered under an uprooted tree in western Slovakia by a tourist who reported the find to the Regional Monuments Board. Archaeologist Matúš Sládok said most of the 147 small, silver coins were Wiener pfennigs minted in Austria, and imitation Wiener pfennings made in Hungary between 1251 and 1330. Sládok thinks the coins may have been wrapped in fabric or leather that has not survived. “Owners hid their movable property, especially finances, in unstable times when they were trying to protect it from enemies and robbers,” he said. The owner may have died or forgotten about the money, he added. "

KYOTO, JAPAN—According to a report in The Asahi Shimbun , eight massive stones, including one that weighs nearly ten tons, have been unearthed in the garden at Muromachi-dono, the so-called Flower Palace built by the Ashikaga Shogunate in A.D. 1381. Clustered at the site of a pond measuring about 150 feet by 200 feet, the stones may have been intended as a show of great power by Ashikaga Yoshimasa, who ruled from 1449 to 1473, since they are much larger than stones found in the gardens of other ruling elites. “Ashikaga Yoshimasa until now hadn’t been held in particularly high regard for his political skills because he triggered the Onin War (1467–1477), which was followed by the Warring States period,” said Hisao Suzuki of Kyoto Sangyo University. “This discovery shows that he excelled at fostering culture and engineering technology.” "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8683-200508-medieval-longbow-wounds,Medieval,"Study Examines Possible Medieval Longbow Wounds. EXETER, ENGLAND—According to a statement released by the University of Exeter , an examination of bones and bone fragments led by archaeologist Oliver Creighton indicates that arrows shot from medieval longbows inflicted small entry and large exit wounds similar to those caused by modern bullets. The arrowheads that caused this damage may have been the “bodkin” type, which were square- or diamond-shaped and designed to pierce armor, Creighton explained. The bones, which were unearthed at a Dominican friary in southwest England, are thought to be the remains of warriors killed in battle at other locations. Their bones were later honored with reburial in holy ground. Creighton and his colleagues identified an arrow puncture wound at the top of the right eye in a cranium dated to the early fifteenth century, with an exit wound at the back of the head. Creighton suggests the arrow had been spinning clockwise, and was thus fletched with feathers. Another puncture wound was found in a right tibia, at what would have been the top of the knight’s calf. This bone was dated to the fourteenth century. Removing an arrow’s shaft from an injured person probably would have caused additional damage, Creighton noted. The study could help archaeologists identify longbow wounds in the archaeological record. "

OXFORD, ENGLAND—According to a Nature report, Amy Bogaard of the University of Oxford and her colleagues analyzed 3,000-year-old grain recovered from a subterranean silo at Hattusha, the capital of the Hittite Empire in central Anatolia. Discovered in 1999, the silo contained hundreds of tons of grain stored in 32 chambers that caught fire shortly after they were put into use. Bogaard and her team members sampled grain from five of these chambers. The different chemical profiles of the grains and the types of weed seeds found intermixed with the wheat and barley suggest that the grain in each chamber came from separate farming communities. The researchers believe the grain was collected as a tax from people who lived across Hittite lands as a display of the king’s wealth. "

LEIPZIG, GERMANY—According to a statement released by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , a team of scientists from Aarhus University, deCODE Genetics, and the Max Planck Society looked for fragments of Neanderthal DNA in the genomes of more than 27,000 Icelanders, combined what they found, and reconstructed at least 38 percent of a Neanderthal genome. When the researchers compared this DNA with other Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes, they found that the Neanderthal DNA in modern Icelanders is more similar to Neanderthal DNA found in Croatians than to Neanderthal DNA found in Russians. Icelanders were also found to carry traces of Denisovan DNA, which may have been transferred to modern humans by Neanderthals whose ancestors mixed with Denisovans. Laurits Skov of Aarhus University and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology added that a comparison of the mutations found on the fragments of Neanderthal DNA with corresponding modern human DNA also suggests that Neanderthal children had older mothers and younger fathers than the modern humans. The researchers concluded that overall, Neanderthal DNA contributes to a slightly reduced risk of prostate cancer, slightly shorter height, and slightly faster blood clotting time for today's Icelanders.

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK—According to a Nature News report, an international team of researchers suggests that the virus that causes smallpox has been in the human population for about 1,700 years, or about 1,000 years longer than previously thought. The scientists screened DNA from the remains of 1,867 people who lived in Eurasia and the Americas between 32,000 and 150 years ago, and detected strands of DNA resembling the genetic makeup of the modern virus that causes smallpox in 26 of them. The researchers then extracted additional genetic material from the remains of 13 of these individuals for further study. Eleven of these individuals came from Scandinavia, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and their remains dated from between A.D. 600 and 1050. Evolutionary geneticist Martin Sikora said that four of these individuals carried a previously unknown strain of the virus. “It’s a separate evolutionary trajectory that died out at some point and, as far as we know, is not present any more today,” Sikora said. The scientists then used the differences between the ancient lineages of the virus and the modern one to determine that they split from a common ancestor about 1,700 years ago, he explained. "

The Great Sacristy was erected on the site of the Abbey’s cemetery in the mid-thirteenth century by Henry III to store monks’ vestments, altar linens, and items used in the Christian Mass. In addition to the building’s foundation, the excavation revealed a stoup, or basin, thought to have been used by the monks to wash their hands before they entered the church; a lead pipe thought to have carried water to the monastery; and fragments of plaster painted with red, white, and black flowers. Before it was demolished in 1740, the structure was used as a dwelling, reflected in the collection of eighteenth-century plates, chamber pots, drinking glasses, combs, and brushes recovered at the site.

Some of the marks on the wolf bones were the result of removing the skin, he explained, but other marks are only associated with dividing a carcass into portions. Wojtal and his team also identified the remains of lions and bears among the artifacts, whose bones also bore marks from skinning and butchering. “Therefore, the meat of these large predators was also eaten by Paleolithic hunters,” he explained.

BERN, SWITZERLAND— Gizmodo reports that evidence for the cultivation of crops some 10,000 years ago has been discovered in southwestern Amazonia by researchers led by Umberto Lombardo of the University of Bern. Lombardo and his team used remote sensing technology to investigate the savannah known as Llanos de Moxos in northeast Bolivia, and detected more than 6,600 areas that had once been forested. Samples of sediments from some of these “forest islands” yielded identifiable fossilized particles of plants called phytoliths from cassava, which is also known as manioc, dated to 10,350 years ago; squash, dated to 10,250 years ago; and maize, dated to 6,850 years ago. “We already knew from genetic studies that manioc was domesticated sometime between 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, so it is the squash evidence that is most surprising,” said paleoecologist S. Yoshi Maezumi of the University of Exeter. “The fact that people were cultivating an already-domesticated squash species by 10,000 years ago implies an even earlier period of pre-domestication cultivation, and it will be extremely interesting to know where this took place.” Lombardo added that the farmers’ diet was probably supplemented with large herbivores and fish.

The oldest of the 130 bone projectile points are thought to have been used to hunt hard-to-catch monkeys, while longer points were eventually crafted to hunt larger pigs and deer. Notches and wear on the points indicate they were used in bow-and-arrow toolkits, the oldest-known weapons of this type to be found outside of Africa. More than 20 of the bone tools are thought to have been used to work animal skins and plant fibers, perhaps to make clothing to serve as protection from insect bites and diseases. It had been previously thought that early clothing was developed as a protection against cold weather. Some of the beads recovered from the cave were made from the pointed tips of marine snail shells, and are thought to have come to the site through trade with people living near the coast. Other beads in the collection are the oldest known to be made entirely of red ochre, the researchers explained. "

Mary Malainey of Brandon University and her colleagues said the objects, which are usually found in fragments, were used as hoes. “This is only the second site in Manitoba where we have that,” she said. The researchers think the hoes were exposed by recent flooding, and so they are looking for other gardening artifacts and evidence of agriculture, storage pits, and houses before they are lost to erosion. “It’s too soon to say which Indigenous population made and used the hoes,” Malainey added. “We know that the people who lived in that area probably lived there for about 200 years from the late 1400s to the 1600s or 1700s.” The displacement caused by the European fur trade, she explained, makes it difficult to pinpoint which ethnic group lived in the area.

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a statement released by Harvard University , Alexander More of Long Island University and the University of Maine and his colleagues compared climate data collected from an ice core from a central European glacier with early twentieth-century historical records, and found that a six-year period of “miserable weather” preceded and overlapped with major battles of World War I and peaks in the numbers of deaths from the Spanish flu. “Basically, we saw a spike in cold, wet marine air from the northwest Atlantic that came down into Europe and lingered,” More said. Trench warfare in the cold, torrential rains and the resulting mud likely contributed to the run-down condition of soldiers’ health, in addition to malnutrition brought on by crop failures. The weather may have also disrupted the migratory patterns of disease-carrying waterfowl, More explained. The outbreak of the Spanish flu in the spring of 1918 is thought to have been connected to troop movements, infecting more than 500 million people and killing between 30 and 50 million. "

The researchers found that there were already five distinct domesticated dog lineages some 11,000 years ago. Traces of these lineages can still be found in living dogs, such as the American lineage in Chihuahuas, and the Siberian lineage in Huskies. The study also suggests that wolf genes did not survive in domesticated dogs, even though wolves acquired dog genes. Larson explained that the introduction of wolf DNA into domesticated dogs could have produced poor guard dogs and hunting companions. “If you’re a dog and you have a bit of wolf in you, that’s terrible,” he said. People would not keep such a dog, he explained. As for the comparison of the dog and human genomes, the study shows that some populations migrated with their dogs. For example, farmers from the Near East traveled with their dogs to Sweden, where they lived together some 5,000 years ago. Other migrants adopted local dogs on arrival, however. "

Translated as “white dog,” Sak Tz’i’ was a small state founded in 750 B.C. and surrounded by more powerful states. The city was protected on one side by steep-walled streams, while masonry walls were built around the rest of the site, but the researchers suspect the city’s leaders must have engaged in political maneuverings with the kingdom’s stronger neighbors in order to survive for more than 1,000 years. The team members have found evidence of pyramids, a royal palace, a ball court, sculptures, and inscriptions describing rituals, battles, a mythical water serpent, and the dance of a rain god.

Mariusz Dyl was looking for shed antlers when he spotted some scattered coins and alerted archaeologists at the Hrubieszów Museum. “We went to the place and together with a team of archaeologists and volunteers, including Mr. Dyl, we continued excavations around the discovery site,” said museum director Bartłomiej Bartecki. Examination of the coins indicates they were minted over a period of about 100 years from the end of the first century to the end of the second century A.D., since the oldest of the coins bears the image of the emperor Nerva, while the latest coin bears an image of Septimius Severus. Bartecki thinks the coins, which equal about six years’ worth of pay for a Roman legionary, had been placed in a wooden box or leather pouch decorated with silver-plated bronze rivets and buried by the Vandals, who were driven out of the region by the Goths between the end of the second century and beginning of the third century A.D. “Perhaps the Vandals hoped that they would return to their lands in the near future, so they decided to bury the coins.

RAMAT-GAN, ISRAEL—Archaeological evidence has allowed researchers to track the rise and fall of Byzantine-era wine production in the Negev Desert, according to a report from The Times of Israel . Excavation of trash pits at three Negev sites—Elusa, Shivta, and Nessana—turned up some 10,000 grape seeds and wheat and barley grains. By comparing the ratio of grape seeds to cereal grains over time, the researchers found that viticulture in the arid region took off in the fourth century A.D. and was extremely productive for some 200 years before dropping off precipitously in the mid-sixth century. The excavations also uncovered a rise in the number of amphoras dating to this period that were used to transport wine to the port of Gaza for export. This suggests “that the rise and fall of Byzantine Negev viticulture was connected to regional and Mediterranean trade,” says Daniel Fuks, an archaeologist at Bar-Ilan University. The decline of the Negev wine industry appears to have been caused by a combination of factors, including a period of unusually cold weather ushered in by volcanic eruptions in the 530s and 540s, the Justinianic Plague of the 540s, and socioeconomic decline that resulted from both phenomena.

Tradition indicates that the abbot of the monastery had hidden its valuables before the attack at Přibĕnice Castle, but the items went missing when the castle was also conquered. The researchers suggest some of those items may be found hidden in the rubble-filled secret corridor. Timbers in the corridor have been dated to the fifteenth century. The archaeologists also found a passageway with a staircase within a surviving twelfth-century wall, a niche with its original decorations, and illusory paintings of gothic windows. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8730-200601-israel-altar-cannabis,Iron Age,"Cannabis Detected on 2,700-Year-Old Altar in Israel. JERUSALEM, ISRAEL—According to a Science News report, researchers led by Eran Arie of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and Dvory Namdar of the Volcani Center of Agricultural Research analyzed residues on two altars placed at the entrance to a shrine discovered in the 1960s at southern Israel’s site of Tel Arad. Part of a fortress guarding the kingdom of Judah’s southern border, the shrine is thought to have been in use between 760 and 715 B.C. and is now on display in the Israel Museum. The analysis detected frankincense mixed with animal fats on one of the altars. The scientists suggest the animal fat would have allowed the fire to burn hot enough to release the resin’s fragrance. Cannabis mixed with animal dung was detected on the other altar. The scientists explained that the animal dung allowed the cannabis to be burned at a lower temperature. They also determined that the amount of the psychoactive compound THC in the sample was enough to have induced an altered state of consciousness. “[C]annabis is completely new for understanding incense burning in this region, and in Judah in particular,” Arie said. Archaeobotanist Robert Spengler of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History added that the plants may have been imported from the East along early Silk Trade routes. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8645-200421-portugal-blue-dye,Medieval,"Scientists Analyze Medieval Blue Pigment. LISBON, PORTUGAL—According to a statement released by NOVA University Lisbon , an interdiciplinary team of researchers from NOVA University Lisbon, University of Porto, and University of Aveiro followed medieval recipes to recreate a blue watercolor dye called folium, which was used to decorate medieval manuscripts, in order to identify its chemical structure. First, the team members collected the berries of the Chrozophora tinctoria plant, which grows in southern Portugal, and followed the directions to extract, treat, and purify the pigment. In the past, the dye was then stored by soaking it up with a small piece of cloth. When dye was needed, a small piece of the cloth was removed and watered in order to release the pigment for use. The scientists isolated the molecule responsible for producing the blue color, and analyzed it with mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and liquid and gas chromatography. Maria João Melo of NOVA University Lisbon said the structure of the molecule, which has been named chrozophoridine, is unlike that found in indigo and other blue flowers and fruits. The information could help conservators preserve medieval artworks adorned with folium. "

Project director Graeme Young said the roundhouse could be more than 2,000 years old. The presence of the roundhouse at the site could help researchers understand the transition from the Roman period to occupation by the Anglo-Saxons, who built a stronghold overlooking the North Sea in the sixth century. “This discovery has the potential to give us fascinating evidence and flesh on the very bare skeleton about the continual occupation of Bamburgh,” Young said.

PETERSBURG, FLORIDA— The Tampa Bay Times reports that renovation of St. Petersburg’s historic Detroit Hotel buidling has revealed a forgotten staircase and fireplace, a wooden telephone switchboard with room numbers written by hand, and an elevator estimated to be about 115 years old. The elevator and its electric motor are intact, although the cables were severed sometime in the past. According to local historian Joey Vars and Nevin Sitler of the St. Petersburg Museum of History, the 40-room hotel was built in 1888 by Russian Peter Demens and John C. Williams, the founders of the city of St. Petersburg, who also built a train station across the street. While the city was named for Demens’ homeland, the hotel was named for Williams.’ As the railroad brought rapid growth to the city, the hotel was expanded. Architectural historian Lee Gray of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte suggests that the elevator was added to the structure around 1897 or 1898. “Even in the 1890s, a lot of towns still didn’t have electricity,” he said. Electricity reached St. Petersburg in 1897. "

Archaeologist Ali Cameron said that more than 300 samples of charcoal had been recovered for dating purposes. It is not clear yet if the site was used as a domestic settlement or for industrial purposes. “If you get a lot of grain, you might be looking at a domestic site, for example,” she said. The samples could also indicate how individual buildings were used. “The site is higher up and you get this fantastic view over the bay,” she added. “It’s a great location and you can imagine why people wanted to settle there.” "

BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA—According to a statement released by the University of Victoria , a team of researchers including members of the Tseshaht First Nation analyzed the bones of domestic dogs spanning a 3,000-year period that were recovered from an ancient Tseshaht settlement located on one of the Broken Group Islands. Dylan Hillis of the University of Victoria and his colleagues found that marine fish, including anchovy, herring, and salmon, made up about half of the diet of the ancient Tseshaht dogs. Hillis explained that the dogs would not have been able to catch the fast-swimming fish on their own. Most of them were small, white dogs, which are known as woolly dogs because they provided the Tseshaht and other First Nations with thick hair for making high-status textiles, although larger “village dogs” also lived in the settlement. Woolly dogs became less popular when sheep’s wool and imported textiles became available, added Tseshaht project director Denis St. Claire. "

The homeowner was beginning to build a bike shed when he found a human skull under just ten inches of soil. Researchers from Historic Environment Scotland were called to the site, and they proceeded to discover the remains of 26 people ranging in age from one to 60, who appear to have been buried in family groups. Below these burials, archaeologists found traces of four Pictish roundhouses and artifacts dated to the Iron Age. “The archaeologists left with two van loads filled to the roof with ancient artifacts,” said homeowner Kristian Leith. Val Turner of the Shetland Amenity Trust said that archaeologists would like to return to the site to look for additional Pictish artifacts. "

The statue fragments are thought to make up 21 Buddha statues, although no heads have been recovered. “The statues were buried and mixed up with some modern items, including a metal door frame, glass shrapnel, a bicycle bell and rim, and even plastic bags,” said project manager Srun Tech, who thinks the statues were buried in the 1960s or 1970s. Tech added that the statue pieces had been buried in an orderly manner, perhaps to protect them from theft. He thinks the heads and other missing parts may still be buried at the twelfth-century temple complex. "

HAIFA, ISRAEL—According to a Live Science report, CT scans have revealed that two small ancient Egyptian sarcophagi held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum in Haifa for more than 50 years did not hold mummified human hearts, as had been noted in museum records. Instead, one of the mummies, which measures 18 inches long and was shaped to resemble Osiris, the god of the afterlife, the dead, life, and vegetation, holds tightly packed grain and mud. “During Osiris festivals that were held, [the ancient Egyptians] would produce these,” said Ron Hillel of Haifa Museums. “It would be a mixture of clay or sand with these grains, and then they would dip it in water and the grains would germinate.” The ritual tied Osiris to death, life and fertility, Hillel explained. The second mummy, which measures about 10 inches long, is bird-shaped and represents the god Horus, the falcon-headed son of Osiris and Isis associated with the sky and pharaohs. Inside, the CT scan revealed the partial remains of a bird, perhaps a falcon. The bird appears to be missing a leg and some of its abdominal organs, and it has a broken neck—an injury thought to have occurred after death. Hillel and the team of researchers studying the mummies now plan to radiocarbon date them. "

VALLETTA, MALTA— The Times of Malta reports that work to restore a collapsed eighteenth-century farmhouse at Tas-Silġ, an archaeological complex on Malta’s southeastern coast, has uncovered the foundations of a Roman temple. The bricks of the farmhouse had been laid directly on the well-preserved Roman foundation. “We were able to find a corner wall, complete with opus signinum flooring, that formed part of the temple,” said Maxine Anastasi of the University of Malta. Opus signinum flooring, made of broken pottery and crushed lime, hardens into durable flooring, she explained. The Roman building likely had a large colonnaded peristyle, she added. Much of the body of the Roman building was probably incorporated into other structures throughout the 1,000 years the site has been occupied. A 3-D digital model of the historic farmhouse was created, but only one of its rooms will now be preserved at the site. "

EXETER, ENGLAND—Naomi Sykes of the University of Exeter and her colleagues suggest that when chickens and brown hares arrived in Britain sometime between the fifth and third centuries B.C., Britons associated them with gods and revered them, according to a CNN report. “When new animals arrive into a culture, they are often linked with deities,” Sykes explained. Intact skeletons of the animals, lacking signs of butchery, have been discovered in individual burials from this period, she added. Butchered hare and chicken bones appear in the archaeological record hundreds of years later, among Roman-period food waste. At this time, Sykes said, hares were farmed for food, and the Romans introduced rabbits to the island, although hares and chickens continued to hold religious associations for Britons. After the Romans withdrew from Britain in A.D. 410, the populations of hares and chickens crashed, Sykes said, and rabbits went extinct. Scarcity may have increased their value among Britons, she added. In the medieval period, chickens and eggs became popular foods, since they were allowed within Christian fasting rules. Rabbits became an elite food item in the thirteenth century, and were widely found in Britain again by the nineteenth century, when they were associated with Christian Easter celebrations, Sykes concluded.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to a statement released by George Washington University , scientist Enquye Negash analyzed the chemical composition of the teeth of herbivores such as antelopes and pigs that lived between one and three million years ago in Ethiopia’s Lower Omo Valley. The results of the study suggest that the animals shifted from eating woody vegetation to grasses and sedges at 2.7 million years ago, and at two million years ago, as the environment shifted to open savannah. Negash and his colleague Jonathan Wynn of the National Science Foundation then examined the chemical composition of the tooth enamel of Paranthropus boisei , an early hominin. The researchers concluded that P. boisei also shifted to eating grasses and sedges some 2.37 million years ago, before the creature’s skull and jaw had adapted to the new foods. All of the herbivores had responded to the ecological changes in their environments in an interconnected way, Wynn explained. "

YORK, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that researchers from the University of York have digitally reconstructed a shrine dedicated to Thomas Becket as it would have looked in A.D. 1408. John Jenkins of the University of York said the team members used information from historical documents, including eye-witness accounts; surviving fragments of the shrine; and an examination of the site where the shrine stood in Canterbury Cathedral to create the reconstruction. Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been engaged in a bitter dispute with King Henry II over the rights of the church when he was slain by knights in the cathedral in 1170. The researchers suggest the shrine was built over a period of about 30 years in the cathedral’s Trinity Chapel sometime between 1180 and 1220. It soon became an important medieval pilgrimage site, receiving some 100,000 visitors a year to honor Becket as a saint and a martyr. The shrine was eventually destroyed during the Protestant Reformation in 1538. "

NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA—According to a report in The Guardian , trash dumped outside the northern wall of the city of Pompeii was recycled and reused. Researcher Allison Emmerson of Tulane University said it had been previously thought that the mounds of trash may have been deposited by an earthquake that occurred about 17 years before the destruction of the city by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. But analysis of soil samples suggests the trash had been taken outside the walls, sorted, and returned to the city for use in new buildings, she explained. “The difference in soil allows us to see whether the garbage had been generated in the place where it was found, or gathered from elsewhere to be reused and recycled,” she said. For example, walls could be constructed from pieces of tile and pottery and lumps of old mortar and plaster. “Almost all such walls received a final layer of plaster, hiding the mess of materials within,” Emmerson said.

The researchers examined modern vegetation patterns found along what is now Africa’s southern coast to develop models of the types of soil, climate, and fire patterns in the Paleo-Agulhas Plain during the Pleistocene. Franklin said that during the last Ice Age, the region offered early modern humans grasslands, floodplains, woodlands, and wetlands teeming with a wide array of plants, animals, and coastal resources. Thus, the rugged cliff caves that are now situated along the coast of South Africa, where some of the oldest anatomically modern human bones and artifacts have been found, were situated along the western edge of the lush plain where early modern humans once lived.

The Northern Line was constructed of pounded earth between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. “Prior to our research, most people thought the wall’s purpose was to stop Genghis Khan’s army,” Shelach-Lavi said. But the team members found that much of this section of the more than 13,000-mile-long Great Wall is low in height and placed near paths, and therefore may not have been intended to deter enemy invasion. “Our conclusion is that it was more about monitoring or blocking the movement of people and livestock, maybe to tax them,” Shelach-Lavi said.

Comparing the DNA of more than 800 people from Polynesian islands and South America's Pacific Coast, researchers led by Andrés Moreno-Estrada of Mexico's National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity found that some people from Rapa Nui, or Easter Island, and surrounding islands have Native American ancestry that derives from individuals of the pre-Columbian Zenu culture, who lived some 800 years ago in what is now Colombia. The geneticists suggest that Polynesians journeyed to South America, bringing back Zenu individuals to the Marquesas and interbreeding with them. Alternatively, they posit, indigenous South Americans could themselves have sailed to eastern Polynesia and encountered Polynesians who had traveled there from farther east. Critics of the study noted similarities between the latter scenario and the controversial claims of Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl, who suggested that South Americans settled Polynesia. "

LEIPZIG, GERMANY—According to a statement released by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology , a third Neanderthal genome has been sequenced by a team of researchers led by Fabrizio Mafessoni. The first sequenced genome belonged to a Neanderthal whose 40,000-year-old remains were found in Croatia’s Vindija Cave, while the second came from a Neanderthal individual whose remains were found in Siberia’s Denisova Cave and dated to about 120,000 years ago. This DNA sample came from female Neanderthal remains dated to between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago that were recovered from Chagyrskaya Cave, which is located in Russia’s Altai Mountains, just 65 miles away from Denisova Cave. Her ancestors are likely to have lived in groups that were smaller and more isolated than Neanderthals who lived elsewhere, the researchers explained. And, she was more closely related to the Neanderthals living in Croatia than those who lived 40,000 years earlier in the same region. Mafessoni said the study therefore supports the idea that Neanderthal populations from the west probably replaced Siberia’s Neanderthal population. The researchers also detected more changes in genes expressed during adolescence in the area of the brain that coordinates planning, decision-making, motivation, and reward perception than in other areas of the brain. These genes may have been affected by small population size or other factors, Mafessoni said. "

Chisel marks are still visible on the dish, which is thought to have fallen into the water with one of the at least 17 crannogs, or Iron Age wooden houses that once stood on stilts at the site. “Because of the fantastic anaerobic conditions, where there is very little light, oxygen, or bacteria to break down anything organic, you get this type of sealed environment,” explained archaeologist Rich Hiden of the Scottish Crannog Centre. Analysis of matter on the dish, he added, detected dairy fat—perhaps butter made of cow’s milk, while holes in the bottom of the dish suggest it was used in the churning process to separate newly formed butter from buttermilk. In addition to keeping dairy animals, the people who lived in the crannogs are known to have grown barley, spelt, and emmer wheat. "

NOVOSIBIRSK, RUSSIA—According to a Siberian Times report, a small statue depicting a person wearing a mask has been recovered from a grave in western Siberia by a team of researchers led by Vyacheslav Molodin of the Novosibirsk Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography. The 5,000-year-old grave has been attributed to the people of the Odinov culture, who raised cattle, sheep, and horses, in addition to hunting and fishing. The figure’s mask, Molodin said, is made of a horse vertebra and may represent a bear’s muzzle. “We’ve never come across anything like this, despite our extensive knowledge of the Odinov culture’s burial rights,” he explained. The statue was placed near the remains of a woman whose body had been placed face-down on a man’s remains. The two were then wrapped in birch bark that had been set on fire. The statue was placed on its front, but with its head broken off and turned face up. A stripe is painted on its face, perhaps to represent a tattoo, while its body features a groove down its middle. Molodin and his team will analyze residues on the statue to try to determine if anything had been placed in the groove. Another two people were buried beneath the pair in the tiered grave, he added.

The items, which have been held in England’s Royal Albert Memorial Museum (RAMM), will be put on display at the Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park in Alberta, Canada. The park is located on traditional Blackfoot lands, at the site where Crowfoot signed Treaty 7 with the Canadian government in September 1877. The agreement, although broken by the Canadian administration, set aside land for the Blackfoot and other First Nations, promised annual payments and provisions, and preserved hunting and trapping rights on the land. In exchange, Canadian officials acquired property to construct the Canadian Pacific Railway. Crowfoot’s personal items are thought to have been acquired at about the time the treaty was signed by Sir Cecil Denny, who worked as an Indian agent in Alberta. The regalia was then loaned to the RAMM by Denny’s sister in 1878. Chief Crowfoot eventually died of tuberculosis in 1890 at Blackfoot Crossing. "

HMAS Patricia Cam , a converted coal ship whose wartime mission involved delivering codebooks to remote coastguard stations, was bombed, strafed, and sunk by a Japanese seaplane on January 22, 1943. The ship had 25 people onboard, including a reverend who was taken hostage by the Japanese and eventually beheaded. Several others died in the bombing or later that day, but 16 survivors made it to a tiny unnamed island and lived to tell the tale. The ship’s remains, however, have never been located. Archaeologist Michael Hermes and antiquarian Mike Owen from the heritage group The PastMasters discovered the crooked piece of Indonesian hardwood on Marchinbar Island. Owen believes it is a part of HMAS Patricia Cam ’s hull called a knee that was used to hold up the floor of the hold, noting that its metal fixings perfectly match those used in the 1940s at the shipyard in New South Wales where the ship was built. A CT scan revealed bits of metal concentrated on one side of the piece of wood—possibly shrapnel from the blast that sank the ship. "

OXFORD, ENGLAND— Science Magazine reports that zoologist Adrian Smith of the University of Oxford and his colleagues looked for the presence of the eggs of intestinal parasites in soil samples collected from the pelvic regions of 600 skeletons unearthed in the Czech Republic, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The burials were dated from the seventh century A.D. through the eighteenth century. The scientists found that the rate of parasitic infection among the individuals in the study stayed fairly stable over time: about 25 percent of them had been infected with whipworm, while about 40 percent were infected with the human roundworm. This rate of parasitic infection is similar to that found today in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico, South America, and East Asia, the researchers explained. The rate of parasitic infection among Europeans dropped by the beginning of the twentieth century, however, probably due to improvements in plumbing, hygiene, and sanitation, since the small, disease-producing worms spread through contact with soil, crops, and water supplies contaminated with infected feces. The scientists concluded that similar structural improvements around the world could wipe out modern parasitic infections. "

OSLO, NORWAY— Live Science reports that Sveinung Rotevatn, Norway’s Minister of Climate and Environment, announced that the 65-foot Gjellestad ship will be excavated in order to protect what is left of it from being destroyed by fungus. The Viking ship, which was buried in a cemetery sometime between the late eighth century and the early tenth century, was discovered in southeastern Norway in 2018 through the use of ground-penetrating radar. Sigrid Mannsåker Gundersen of the Viken County Council thinks the ship may have once made long distance voyages under sail and rowing power. It has not yet been determined if the vessel had a mast. The fungus was detected during a test excavation in 2019. “Only the imprints of the planks—or ‘strakes’—were left, together with the iron nails. The only part that was still solid wood was the keel,” Mannsåker Gundersen said. The imprints, the brittle keel, and soil analysis could still offer researchers valuable information about the ship and the grave, he added. "

The castle was built by Henry VIII in the sixteenth century on England’s southern coast in anticipation of a French invasion attempt. The tunnels were added in the early nineteenth century to allow defenders to fire at attackers. “The discovery highlights the change in Southsea from a purely military site to a fashionable holiday resort during the nineteenth century,” explained Naomi Brennan of Wessex Archaeology. The work will help shore up the site from erosion damage. "

QUINTANA ROO, MEXICO—According to a Mexico News Daily report, researchers from Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) have found traces of a Maya village dating to A.D. 1200 near the Caribbean coast in the eastern Yucatán Peninsula. Archaeologist Fernando Cortés de Brasdefer said the site is the first settlement to be found in the southern region that dates to the period after the political collapse and abandonment of Classic period Maya cities. In addition to the remains of some 80 structures, which were made of adobe, wood, and guano palms on limestone platforms, INAH archaeologists have identified wells and water storage receptacles. The village residents are thought to have been farmers who supplemented their diet with fish, Cortés explained, and their proximity to the sea would have allowed them to trade with other coastal towns. However, the team members have not unearthed any evidence of palaces or ritual structures, nor have they recovered any pottery, stone tools, or bones from the site. Cortés thinks the town may have only been inhabited for a short period of time. "

LONDON, ENGLAND— Gizmodo reports that evidence unearthed at Chahak, an archaeological site in southern Iran, suggests that ancient Persians added a chromium mineral to their alloys to produce low-chromium steel in the eleventh century A.D. It had been previously thought that chromium steel, also known as stainless steel, was first produced in the twentieth century. Steel was produced at the site by placing a mixture of iron and other minerals, including about one to two percent chromium and two percent phosphorus, in long, tubular crucibles, which were sealed and warmed in a furnace. After the metal and crucible had cooled, the crucible was broken open and the ingot removed. The addition of chromium made the strong and hard metal, which was probably used to produce swords, daggers, and armor, according to Rahil Alipour of University College London. The phosphorus, however, added to reduce the melting point of the mixture, made it fragile. “Chahak chromium crucible steel would have been similar in terms of its properties to modern tools steel,” Alipour said. Documents from the period noted that blades made in Chahak sold for a high price, but could be brittle. The presence of chromium could be used to identify items produced at Chahak, he added. "

NOVÁ BAŇA, SLOVAKIA— The Slovak Spectator reports that a team of archaeologists and volunteers have uncovered the base of what is thought to be Europe’s first atmospheric steam engine at a mining site in the town of Nová Bańa. The machine, built by Isaac Potter in a mine shaft between 1721 and 1722, was used to drain water from the site. The engine room, which was discovered last year, turned out to be larger than expected. “There were many tiles from a stove inside,” said Matej Styk of Constantine the Philosopher University. “We think that the building was wooden. It has a stone foundation wall and inside another production activity was ongoing.” A mining button dated to the nineteenth century, a pipe, and iron nails were also recovered. When the mine at Nová Bańa failed to recover any ore, historic records indicate that the machine was supposed to have been moved to Banská Štiavnica, another town in central Slovakia known for its silver mines. “There we lost its traces, because the supposed shift to Banská Štiavnica did not happen,” added Peter Konečný of the Slovak mining archive. The local mining association plans to build a replica steam engine at the site as part of an open-air museum. "

KYOTO, JAPAN— The Asahi Shimbun reports that researchers from the Kyoto City Archaeological Research Institute uncovered a castle wall and moat to the southeast of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. The structure is thought to have been completed by the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi in A.D. 1597, one year before his death. The surviving castle wall, which measures about 26 feet long and varies in height from three to five feet tall, is made up of three to four courses of stone. When intact, the wall probably stood about eight feet tall, based upon fallen stones discovered in the backfilled moat, estimated to have been about ten feet wide and eight feet deep. Gold-plated roof tiles bearing the family crest of the Toyotomi family were also recovered from the moat. Historian Kazuto Hongo of the University of Tokyo suggested that Toyotomi Hideyoshi built the castle as a way to pass his rank to his son and successors. Its careful construction was likely intended to inspire admiration in the nobles in the Imperial Palace, added researcher Soichiro Itagaki. "

BRADFORD, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Independent , an international team of researchers led by scientists from the University of Bradford analyzed sediments collected in Doggerland, an area now submerged by the North Sea that once connected the United Kingdom to the rest of Europe. The study suggests that a series of tsunamis, triggered by a massive landslide off the coast of Norway some 8,150 years ago, affected a wider area than previously thought, and may have killed one quarter of Britain’s estimated population of 50,000 people who depended upon marine resources for survival. “The multidisciplinary investigation we carried out reveals that the tsunami wasn’t just a single wave—but impacted the now submerged southern North Sea area we examined in three successive inundations, probably spread over just a few hours at most,” said geophysicist Richard Bates of the University of St. Andrews. In addition, the waves probably disrupted the food supply, which may have increased competition for resources and strife between groups of hunter-gatherers. Evidence of such post-tsunami violence has been unearthed on Denmark’s western coast, the researchers explained. "

The bottles came from several brewers, but most are labeled “J.E. Richardson of Leeds,” according to archaeologist David Williams. The bottles are thought to date to the 1880s, he added. “This excavation is giving us a great opportunity to uncover a part of Georgian and Victorian Leeds,” Williams said. “The results so far are giving a real insight to the daily lives of the former residents of Leeds during this period.” Several of the beer bottles still contained liquid. Williams and his team members originally thought the liquid might have been ginger beer, but analysis showed that it contained alcohol and high levels of lead. Water used to make the beer is thought to have been contaminated by lead piping. "

The beds consisted of bound bunches of grass, such as Guinea grass and red grass, placed over a layer of ash. The ashes are likely to have been old bedding that was burned in firepits found not far from the grass beds found at the entrance to the cave. The fine, powdery ash under the bedding may have been intended to discourage crawling insects. Bits of burned wood and camphor leaves in the ash may have also served as bug repellent. People may have sat on their beds while making stone tools, since small, sharpened stones were also found in the grass and ash. "

ODENSE, DENMARK—According to a statement released by the University of Southern Denmark , chemical analysis of the levels of copper in human bones can indicate the use of copper cookware in the past. Kaare Lund Rasmussen and his colleagues measured the level of copper in 55 skeletons ranging from 200 to 1,200 years old that were recovered from nine cemeteries in rural and urban areas in Denmark and northern Germany. The researchers found high levels of copper in the bones of people who lived in towns during the Viking and medieval periods, which they believe came from copper pots scraped by metal cooking utensils. Acidic foods stored in copper vessels may have absorbed the metal as well, Rasmussen explained. People who lived in rural areas did not ingest enough copper for it to be detectable in their bones, however. Rasmussen suggests country-dwellers were likely to have prepared their food in pots made of other materials, despite the popular historic image of a country kitchen equipped with a copper pot. Rasmussen thinks a copper pot may have been so unusual in rural areas that it may have been talked about and recorded. "

In the sixteenth century, the building housed a convent where the remains of philosopher Michel de Montaigne, who served as mayor of Bordeaux from 1581 to 1585, may have come to rest after his body was moved several times following his death in 1592. Archaeoanthropologist Helene Reveillas said the well-preserved skeleton, which was recovered from a lead coffin found within a wooden coffin inscribed with the word “Montaigne,” belonged to an adult who may have been male. “We have elements which do not go against the idea that this is de Montaigne. But we also have nothing which allows us to affirm it with certainty,” she explained. Montaigne is known to have suffered from kidney stones, and his heart was removed from his body at the request of his widow. The research team will now look for such evidence when studying the tissue, pollen, and insects found in the coffin, and radiocarbon date the remains, Reveillas added. "

The coins include gold ducats bearing the image of Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, Albrecht of Austria, and Rupert of the Palatinate; ducats from the Hanseatic city of Lübeck; more than 300 silver groschen minted in Bohemia; and groschen bearing the image of John of Bohemia, the Duke of Luxembourg. Metlička said the monastery was located on a medieval trade route that connected Prague and Nuremberg, although researchers do not know why the coins might have been hidden. "

ALBERTA, CANADA— Live Science reports that Lidio Valdez of the University of Calgary and his colleagues discovered the naturally mummified remains of five young llamas thought to have been sacrificed by the Inca some 500 years ago at Tambo Viejo, an archaeological site on the coast of Peru. The animals wore colorful string necklaces and earrings, and had been decorated with red paint and the feathers of tropical birds attached to wooden sticks. One brown llama and three white ones were found beneath the clay floors of one building, in an area disturbed by looters. A single brown llama was found under the floor of a second building. Valdez said no cut marks have been found on the animals, but their legs had been tied, so they may have been buried alive to honor the gods as part of a huge feast. “The adornments suggest that the offerings were very special,” Valdez said. “Indeed, historical records indicate that brown llamas were sacrificed to the creator Viracocha, while white llamas to the sun, the Inca main deity.” A guinea pig was found with one of the white llamas, he added. Pits holding maize cobs, lima beans, guinea pigs, and a package of ash that may have been used when chewing coca leaf were also found near the three white llamas. "

TÜBINGEN, GERMANY—According to a statement released by the University of Tübingen , an Iron Age winepress has been unearthed in Lebanon at the Phoenician site of Tell el-Burak, a small settlement inhabited from the late eighth to the middle of the fourth century B.C. The seventh-century B.C. winepress was built into the slope of a hill with plaster made of lime and crushed ceramics. Such lime plaster, made with a technique also used by the Romans, was hardwearing and water-resistant. Adriano Orsingher, Jens Kamlah, Silvia Amicone, and Christoph Berthold of the University of Tübingen and Hélène Sader of the American University in Beirut suggest the settlement was founded to supply the nearby trading town of Sidon with agricultural products. Earlier research at the site uncovered evidence of large-scale grape cultivation and a large number of amphoras that may have been used to transport wine. "

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL— The Jerusalem Post reports that Ashkelon Academic College and University of Haifa archaeologist Rafael Lewis believes he has pinpointed the site of the Battle of Arsuf, a key engagement of the Third Crusade. Long celebrated in the West as a great victory, the battle took place on September 7, 1191, when England’s Richard I, or Richard the Lionheart, led his forces against an army commanded by the great Muslim military leader Saladin. The exact location of the battlefield has since been lost. To recover it, Lewis studied a combination of historical and environmental records, and analyzed a network of medieval-era roads to identify an area north of Tel Aviv as the likely site of the battle. A limited survey of the area with a metal detector led Lewis to unearth Crusader-era artifacts, including two arrowheads and a horseshoe dating to the late twelfth or early thirteenth centuries. While the Battle of Arsuf is celebrated as a great victory by European sources, Lewis points out that the Crusaders failed to recapture Jerusalem, the main objective of their campaign. "

DORSET, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that land snail shells discovered in soil samples taken from the Cerne Abbas Giant, a figure carved into a chalk hillside in southwest England, suggest that the landmark is unlikely to be prehistoric, and probably dates to the Middle Ages, at the earliest. An exact date for the landmark derived from tests using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), a technique that determines when minerals in the soil were last exposed to sunlight, is expected later this year, but researchers have now identified a snail species in the samples known to have arrived in Britain sometime in the 13th or 14th centuries. ""They arrived here accidentally, probably in straw and hay used as packing for goods from the continent,"" said environmental archaeologist Mike Allen. ""Sadly, this shows the giant is unlikely to be prehistoric or Roman, and more likely dates to medieval times or later."" The earliest mention of the Cerne Abbas Giant was recorded in 1694, and local folklore has long held the 180-foot chalk figure to be a fertility aid. Allen also said that the snail shell testing suggests that there have been periods in the figure's history when the giant was grown over with grass and other vegetation. "

WOLLONGONG, AUSTRALIA—Jacques Jaubert of the University of Bordeaux, Eline Schotsmans of the University of Wollongong and the University of Bordeaux, and their colleagues donned protective gear and entered Grotte de Cussac, a cave in Dordogne, France, in order to examine the remains of six people who were interred there between 25,000 and 30,000 years ago, according to a Cosmos Magazine report. The cave is known for its hundreds of Paleolithic engravings depicting animals and humans. The researchers determined from their observations that the human remains, which rest in three locations within the cave, had been placed in hollows dug out and abandoned by hibernating bears. Two of those so-called nests had been covered with red ochre before the human remains were placed there. All of the remains belonged to teenagers and adults, and some of the skeletons were incomplete. For example, in some of the nests, no crania were found, although the teeth had been left behind, Schotsmans noted, suggesting that the people who used the Grotte de Cussac had manipulated the remains. In addition, the researchers noticed that the remains of some of the individuals had been intermingled. "

ITHACA, NEW YORK—According to a report in the Olean Times Herald , Sturt Manning of Cornell University and John Hart of the New York State Museum have obtained new radiocarbon dates from Native American sites in upstate New York and created a new timeline for the occupation of the Mohawk and Hudson River Valley regions at the time of European contact. Because Europeans traveled by river from the coast into New York in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, timelines for Native American settlement of these areas had relied upon the arrival of European goods such as metal items and glass beads. But Manning noted that not all Native American groups accepted contact or goods from Europeans. The researchers thus analyzed metal goods from the settlements with portable X-ray fluorescence to see if they may have been crafted from local materials, collected new radiocarbon dates of organic materials such as maize kernels, and conducted a statistical analysis of archaeological and historical information. The results of the study suggest that the shift to larger, fortified communities at some Iroquoian sites did not occur in the mid-fifteenth century, as previously thought, but between the mid-sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries.

MAINZ, GERMANY—According to a statement released by Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz , a team of researchers has analyzed genomes obtained from the remains of more than 100 people all thought to have been warriors killed in combat during the same battle around 1200 B.C. and buried near the banks of the Tollense River in northern Germany. The study found that only about one in eight of the dead were able to digest the lactose in milk, some 4,000 years after dairy farming had been introduced to Europe. Population geneticist Joachim Burger said that people who live in the region today have genomes largely similar to those buried along the Tollense River, but about 90 percent of them are able to digest milk sugar. Daniel Wegmann of the University of Fribourg said that for such a change to have taken place in just 3,000 years, lactase-persistent individuals must have had more children, or their children must have had a better chance of survival than those who did not carry the genetic adaptation. Burger explained that milk provides energy, and could be less contaminated than drinking water, which may have been a decisive factor in the survival of young children after they were weaned from mother’s milk.

BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA—According to a Science News report, neuroscientist Alan Cowen and psychologist Dacher Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley, turned to ancient sculptures to see if human facial expressions could signal the same emotions across cultures. Previous comparisons of facial expressions of living people have been questioned because of the far-reaching influence of modern Western cultural practices. The new study presented more than 300 English-speakers with photographs of just the faces of sculptures made in Mexico and Central America between 3,500 and 600 years ago, and asked them to assess the statues’ expressions according to a list of 30 emotions or emotional states. The statues portrayed people who were being held captive, tortured, carrying a heavy object, embracing someone, holding a baby, preparing to fight, playing a ballgame, or playing music. More than 100 other participants were asked to rate how people in those same situations would express the same emotions or emotional states. The study found that the sculptures’ facial expressions aligned with what the participants expected to see, and suggests that humans may have evolved a wider set of facial expression to convey more emotions that had been previously thought.

NORFOLK, ENGLAND— The Guardian reports that artifacts dating back to the Tudor period were discovered during roof repairs at eastern England’s Oxburgh Hall, which was built in the late fifteenth century by the devout Catholic Bedingfeld family. In 1559, Sir Henry Bedingfeld refused to sign the Act of Uniformity, which outlawed the Catholic Mass. As a result, the Bedingfelds were persecuted and ostracized by the Tudor court. A complete personal prayer book with a gilded leather binding, found in an attic void by a builder, may have been concealed by the family. Among debris in a rat’s nest found under floorboards in the northwest corner of the attic, archaeologist Matt Champion recovered more than 200 well-preserved pieces of textiles such as silks, satin, leather, velvet, wool, and embroidery dating to the late Tudor, Elizabethan, and early Georgian periods, and scraps of handwritten music dated to the sixteenth century. Fragments of pages from the hidden book were also found in the nest. Under the floorboards near the attic’s south-facing windows, Champion found document fragments, evidence of wax seals, and hundreds of pins, indicating that the well-lit area was used for sewing and writing in the eighteenth century.

DNA from rice was identified in the tartar of eight of the individuals. The DNA of other foods, including daikon radish, the minty herb “shiso” perilla, green onion, Japanese chestnut, carrot, and pumpkin was also identified. The researchers noted that these foods are described in records of the period. DNA from tobacco plants, which may have been smoked, was also found in the tartar. Resin from tropical lowland rainforest trees detected in the tartar is thought to have been used as a tooth powder. “The technique will make it possible to survey what each individual ate,” Sawafuji said of the project. Such analysis could allow researchers to determine which foods were used as staples, and even which were an individual’s favorite foods, he added. "

SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND— The Independent reports that researchers led by Rodrigo Pacheco-Ruiz of the University of Southampton investigated the wreckage of UC-47, a German submarine sunk off the coast of northern England by the Royal Navy in 1917. Sonar 3-D images and video collected with two remotely-operated unmanned submarines reveal the damage sustained by the submarine when it was rammed by Patrol Boat HMS P-57, which had been fitted with a strengthened bow. The Royal Navy vessel then dropped depth charges on the sunken submarine over a period of several days. Both technologies were developed to fight German U-boats and the plan to prevent the British from transporting coal, steel, timber, and cement by sea. German naval officials suggested after the war that Royal Navy divers had entered the UC-47 to retrieve intelligence documents, including a map of German mines laid against British shipping, but Pacheco-Ruiz said the wreckage rests under more than 150 feet of water, making such an operation unlikely. He thinks the crew of P-57 may have dropped the multiple depth charges in an effort to create holes in the wreckage so that documents could float to the surface. Scholars will search German naval archives for more information on how German officials learned about British intelligence gathering. "

The pottery fragments were found in 2019 in a trash pit that also contained animal bones, musket balls, gun parts, flints, buttons, seashell jewelry, and belt buckle fragments. Archaeologist Homer Thiel said most of the pottery fragments in the pit were red and brown, from vessels that had been made by the local Tohono O’odham. But 29 pieces of whiteware pottery associated with the Pueblo people of northern Arizona and western New Mexico were also recovered. Ceramic analyst Jim Heidke determined that four of these fragments had been made by the Zuni in the late 1700s or early 1800s, in a style known for its white-polished coating and bold red and black decorations. “It’s pretty distinctive. There’s nothing else like it,” Heidke said. The presidio inhabitants also owned majolica dishes from Mexico City, Chinese porcelains, and olive jars from Europe, Thiel added. "

OXFORD, ENGLAND—According to a Gizmodo report, an international team of scientists including Victoria Smith of the University of Oxford and Dario Pedrazzi of Geosciences Barcelona–CSIC has pinpointed the date of the Tierra Blanca Joven volcanic eruption in El Salvador to A.D. 431, through the analysis of volcanic shards recovered from ice cores in Greenland, the levels of sulphur recorded in ice cores from Antarctica, and radiocarbon dating of a charred tree recovered from a layer of volcanic ash. The researchers also mapped ash deposits and bits of volcanic debris over an area of 77,220 square miles in order to create a simulation of the eruption. The model indicates that the volcano’s plume reached 28 miles high, covered much of Central America in ash, and spread ash all the way to Greenland. Smith, Pedrazzi, and their colleagues suggest that researchers look for the impact of the eruption on world events circa A.D. 431. They noted that the archaeological record of Maya ceramic production within 50 miles of the Ilopango caldera paused about 1,500 years ago, and resumed after a period of about 100 to 150 years. "

Pelton said the Ogburn-Golden Bison Jump, which has been named after the teens, is between 1,000 to 1,500 years old. “This particular site is—the best way to put it is that there is no way that bison bone would have ended up where it was without humans having a role in it. These bison bones are perched up on some pretty steep, cliffy areas, and it is not in a place where you would expect an animal to die naturally,” he explained. Driving the buffalo up the steep embankment and confining them there would have made them easier targets for hunters traveling on foot and equipped with bows and arrows. Stone points have been found among the bones, Pelton added. The people who hunted here, he said, lived in semipermanent seasonal camps and had a trade network that extended to the Pacific Ocean. "

Yanagida noted that pottery from Lelang, a Han Dynasty administrative center established by China on the Korean Peninsula in 108 B.C., has also been found at the Japanese site of Mikumo-Iwara, an ancient capital mentioned in a Chinese record of encounters with Japan. An ink slab dated to the first or second century A.D. was discovered at Mikumo-Iwara in 2016. Yanagida suggests writing may have been introduced to Japan from China along with Lelang pottery, and spread throughout Japan hundreds of years earlier than previously thought. "

MUNICH, GERMANY— Live Science reports that a team of scientists created a 3-D image of the body of a child who died in Egypt sometime between 50 B.C. and A.D. 100 with CT scans and X-rays, and then compared the likeness with his mummy portrait. Examination of his teeth indicate the child was between the ages of three and four at the time of death. Andreas Nerlich of the Academic Clinic Munich-Bogenhausen said the resulting facial reconstruction is very similar to the ancient painting, although the child appears to be a bit older in his portrait. The likeness may have been painted shortly before or after his death, Nerlich surmised. The scan also revealed residues of condensed lung tissue indicating that the boy likely died of pneumonia, and that his brain and some of his abdominal organs had been removed during the process of mummification. Similar studies of mummies of adults found that an older man’s mummy portrait portrayed him when he was young, and another mummy had been given the wrong portrait altogether, based upon the proportions of his skull.

HOLON, ISRAEL— BBC News reports that a volunteer member of a team of researchers led by Liat Nadav-Ziv and Elie Haddad of the Israel Antiquities Authority discovered a cache of more than 400 solid gold coins and pieces of cut gold coins during an archaeological investigation at a construction site in central Israel. Stored in a clay vessel, which had been buried and secured with a nail, most of the coins were minted in the late ninth century A.D., when what is now central Israel was part of the Islamic Abbasid Caliphate. Altogether, the cache would have been enough money to purchase a luxurious house in Fustat, the capital of Egypt, the researchers explained. One of the cuttings is a fragment of a gold solidus minted in Constantinople during the mid-ninth-century reign of Byzantine emperor Theophilos. Coin expert Robert Kool said the presence of the solidus is evidence of contact through war and trade between the two empires. "

Brooches, pottery, small iron knives, wrist clasps, amber and glass beads, and silver pennies were uncovered among the more than 200 burials. “Due to the highly acidic soil the skeletons had mostly vanished and were luckily preserved as fragile shapes and shadows in the sand,” said archaeologist Andrew Peachey. The fragile artifacts were removed in blocks of soil for micro-excavation at Norfolk Museum Service, he added. Several generations of a small farming community are thought to have been buried at the site. "

POSEDARJE, CROATIA— Total Croatia News reports that Mato Ilkić and Mate Parica of the University of Zadar have found the remains of a port in the western Novigrad Sea, a bay at the foot of the Velebit Mountains, that sheds new light on Liburnia’s maritime role in ancient trade. Wood from the submerged structure has been radiocarbon dated to between 371 and 199 B.C., before the Roman conquest. “For now, it is the oldest port in Liburnia, and perhaps in the entire Croatian part of the Adriatic,” Ilkić said. The port was situated next to the site of Budim, a large prehistoric hillfort, he added. The Liburnians traded with Carthage, Numidia, and Hellenistic Egypt in North Africa, and then moved those goods inland, beyond the mountains. Pottery from Italy was also recovered at the site. "

TRONDHEIM, NORWAY—Archaeologists from the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology Museum report that they have discovered a bronze cauldron in an ancient cemetery located in the path of a highway slated for construction through central Norway’s Gaula River Valley. Team member Merete Moe Henriksen said the researchers first investigated the area with a metal detector, and therefore expected to find something under the burial cairn’s stones. Cremated human remains had been placed in the Roman-style vessel, which is believed to have been manufactured in Italy or Roman provinces of the Rhine region sometime between the second and third centuries A.D. It was then wrapped in birch bark, buried, and covered with a stone slab. Henriksen and her colleagues think such vessels were mass produced for export to Scandinavia, where they were often used as burial urns by the elite. As many as 50 such vessels have been uncovered in Norway. Evidence of repairs indicate this vessel was probably used for another purpose before it ended up in the grave, where it was compressed by the weight of the cairn. Conservators will now examine the vessel and its contents in detail. "

JENA, GERMANY— Cosmos Magazine reports that an international team of scientists analyzed DNA samples from 93 people who lived on islands in the Caribbean Sea between 400 and 3,200 years ago, and found evidence for at least three waves of migrants. The first two waves included people from North America who traveled to the western Caribbean. They were then followed by a more recent wave of people from South America some 2,800 years ago. Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen explained that this genetic evidence supports archaeological data from the islands. The Caribbean Sea, rather than acting as an obstacle to migrants, as had been previously thought, appears to have served as an “aquatic motorway” for repeated interaction between people living on the islands and on the mainland, according to Kathrin Nägele of the University of Copenhagen. Researcher Cosimo Posth of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History added that the genetic study also supported archaeological evidence suggesting that there had been little mixture between the different groups once they arrived on the islands.

CAIRO, EGYPT— Ahram Online reports that a team led by Mohammed Abd Al-Badea discovered a series of rock-cut openings in a cliff while surveying Upper Egypt’s valley of Abydos. No burials have been found at the site, but pottery suggests it was used during the Ptolemaic period, from 304 to 30 B.C. Mostafa Waziri of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities explained that the chambers started as natural formations created by flowing water over thousands of years. The openings carved into the cliff face lead to areas with single and multiple chambers, which are connected with narrow doorways cut into the rock. The chambers were equipped with shallow niches, benches, depressions or troughs cut into the floor, and holes cut into the walls just below the ceiling. Handholds or places to attach rope were found near the doorways. One graffito naming Khuusu-n-Hor, his mother Amenirdis, and grandmother Nes-Hor was found in one chamber, and a single carving depicting two small figures was found near one of the entrances. "

The fragments were given to experts at the University of Leeds in the 1950s for chemical analysis because they were thought to be blank. Taylor was looking at one of the fragments, now housed in the University of Manchester’s John Rylands Library, with a magnifying glass when she thought she saw a faded letter. The researchers photographed both sides of 51 bits of scroll with multispectral imaging, and found that four of them bore readable Hebrew/Aramaic text written in carbon-based ink. Ruled lines and traces of letters were observed on other fragments, the researchers added. The largest fragment of text, made up of 15 or 16 letters arranged in four lines, contains the word “Shabbat,” and may be related to the biblical book of Ezekiel. "

NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND— The Guardian reports that researchers led by retired army colonel Andrew Marriott of Newcastle University used X-ray fluorescence to examine the chemical composition of Victoria Cross medals made between 1856 and 2013. Tradition suggests the award, which was instituted by Queen Victoria, was crafted from Russian guns captured at the siege of Sevastapol in 1855. The investigation found, however, that the composition of the medals changed during World War I, and again during World War II. “Although we know that Queen Victoria decreed that the new honor be cast from bronze, there is no evidence to suggest that she wanted captured weapons from Sevastopol to be used for this purpose,” Marriott said. During a World War I metal shortage, Britain’s War Office supplied the sole producer of the award with metal from Crimean guns, based on a tradition Marriott thinks originated in a newspaper report of an 1857 medal ceremony. Medals made now are thought to be sourced from a nineteenth-century cannon from another conflict. “While it’s unlikely that even the earliest medals came from the ordnance captured at Sevastopol, it is clear that most of the VCs awarded since the First World War have plausibly been sourced from the cascabels of captured guns—an important and symbolic fact for those who have received the honor in recognition of their bravery,” Marriott concluded.

WALLA WALLA, WASHINGTON— The Union-Bulletin reports that trolley tracks installed in 1906 were unearthed during an infrastructure repair project in Walla Walla. The 450 feet of track were once part of a system that connected the center of the city to outlying areas. Each trolley car, equipped with an onboard electric motor connected to overhead wires with metal rods, held 28 to 72 passengers. A previous archaeological investigation of the city’s trolley system studied a different section of rails, which was marked with the name of the manufacturer and date of construction. A piece of these rails was preserved at the Fort Walla Walla Museum. The trolley line closed in 1926 as the automobile became popular. “I don’t know what the financial investment was back then but it had to have been substantial,” said city engineer Mike Laughery. “I don’t know if they just didn’t foresee the development of the automobile or how that played out.” "

BEISAMOUN, ISRAEL— Live Science reports that a team of researchers led by Fanny Bocquentin of the French National Center for Scientific Research has analyzed a 9,000-year-old cremation burial unearthed in northern Israel’s Upper Jordan Valley. The study suggests that the body of a young adult was placed in a seated position with knees bent to the chest in or just above a U-shaped pit that was lined with reddish mud plaster. After the fire started, the body is thought to have fallen forward and rotated. The chemical composition of the 355 scorched bone fragments recovered from the burial indicates the fire reached at least 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit. Bocquentin said that although the individual’s cause of death is unknown, the team members found a flint projectile point embedded in the left shoulder bone. The wound had begun to heal, indicating that the person had survived for at least several weeks after sustaining the injury. The team members also detected the presence of sedges, a type of rush used to make baskets and matting, in the grave. The plants may have been used to wrap the body in a shroud, Bocquentin explained. The hundreds of fragments of animal bones in the cremation pit may have come from animals used as fuel or offerings, or the bones may have been refuse in the dirt used to infill the grave. "

Raphael was buried in the Pantheon at the time of his death at the age of 37 in 1520. In 1833, his tomb and several others were exhumed, and a plaster cast was made of the artist’s purported skull, before the remains were reinterred. Molecular biologist Mattia Falconi of Tor Vergata University said the 3-D reconstruction matches Raphael’s self-portraits and images of him painted by others. “The 3-D model shows the eyes and mouth [in the portraits] are his, but he has been kind to himself about his nose,” Falconi commented. The researchers now plan to obtain a sample of the remains in Raphael’s tomb for genetic study. "

EXETER, ENGLAND—According to a statement released by the University of Exeter , researchers from the University of Exeter and Brazil’s State University of Mato Grosso sampled some 4,000 trees in southern and eastern Amazonia, and found that areas of the Amazon where so-called “dark earth” is found have more diverse ecosystems. Edmar Almeida de Oliveira explained that this vegetation includes more edible fruit trees and different species of colossal trees than are found in the surrounding forest. The study shows that these patches of dark earth, which were created over a period of 5,000 years by early farmers who fertilized the soil with charcoal from fires and food waste, still have more nutrients and are thus more fertile than untreated soils. Early farmers are thought to have grown food in the treated soils and forested trees from untreated areas. Dark earth areas were abandoned, the researchers added, when indigenous communities collapsed after the arrival of Europeans. "

GUILDFORD, ENGLAND—According to a statement released by UCL Institute of Archaeology , decorated niches, writing, and other markings estimated to date to the late fourteenth century have been found in a small sandstone cave in southeastern England. The artwork suggests the cave was used as a Christian shrine or hermitage associated with the nearby medieval ruins of a church dedicated to St. Catherine. Discovered during work to stabilize the railway embankment, the cave is thought to have been much larger before railroad tracks were installed in the early 1840s. Researchers from UCL's Archaeology South-East examined the cave's eight or nine niches that feature inscriptions or etched initials, including a Gothic shrine adorned with carved dots and a Calvary cross. Carbon from black deposits on the ceiling, thought to be soot from lamps, and two fire pits in the cave will be radiocarbon dated. The archaeologists note that the hill where the cave is located was once known as Drakehull, or “The Hill of the Dragon,” and may have held ritual significance before the construction of the Christian church in the late thirteenth century.

The scientists radiocarbon dated charred corn kernels recovered from Cahokia’s homes and shrines, and analyzed the carbon isotopes in the teeth and bones of more than 100 people and 15 dogs buried near those structures. The study suggests that the residents of Cahokia began to eat corn at about the same time they began to build mounds and adopt fertility iconography, Emerson said. Around A.D. 1050, the village of Cahokia began to expand rapidly into a city where as many as 10,000 people lived. In addition, archaeobotanist Mary Simon said that some 2,000 years ago, it would have been very difficult to grow corn, which had originally been cultivated in Mesoamerica, in what is now the Midwestern United States because of the difference in the amount of available sunlight. It would have taken time for the plant to evolve and adapt to the new environment, she explained. "

Named the “Venus of Egerszeg,” the sculpted clay fragment depicts a woman’s torso. The researchers suggest that the figure was deliberately broken into small pieces as part of a fertility rite. Other ceramic fragments, some of which had been painted yellow, red, and white, and stone tools were also recovered. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8523-200316-mexico-ball-court,Pre-Columbian,"3,400-Year-Old Ball Court Found in Mexico’s Highlands. WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to a Science News report, Jeffrey Blomster and Victor Salazar Chávez of George Washington University and their colleagues have found a ball court estimated to be 3,400 years old at the site of Etlatongo in the mountains of southern Mexico, pushing back the arrival of the game in the highlands by about 800 years. It had been previously thought that the game originated in settlements located on the Gulf Coast and the Pacific lowlands. Found underneath a larger ball court built around 1200 B.C., the court covered an area of about 1,500 square yards and featured stone walls and benches. Charred animal bones, plant remains, human bones, and pieces of ceramic ballplayer figurines suggest it had been burned when it was taken out of use. “Multiple regions and societies were involved in developing a blueprint for the ball court used in a formal ball game across Mesoamerica,” Blomster said, although how the ball game was first played remains unknown.

OSAKA, JAPAN— The Mainichi reports that the remains of more than 1,500 people have been found at a cemetery site slated for redevelopment in Osaka, which is located on the south-central coast of the island of Honshu. The Umeda Haka cemetery, founded in the early seventeenth century during the Edo period, was one of seven in the city and is thought to have been used by people who lived in the Osaka Castle area of the city into the early twentieth century. Archaeologists investigating the site said they have found bodies buried in wooden tubs, square wooden coffins, and funeral urns, in addition to cremated remains. In the northern part of the cemetery, the researchers found that some of the dead had been placed directly into the soil, sometimes in multiple burials, perhaps during times of epidemics. Artifacts recovered from the cemetery include beads, coins, pipes, earthen dolls, gold coins, and miniature plates and pots. Scientists will continue to study the bones, but preliminary reports indicate that some of the individuals suffered from syphilis and bone tumors. "

ATHENS, GREECE— The National Herald reports that excavators led by archaeologist Efi Sapouna-Sakellaraki at the site of Zominthos, a palace built around 2000 B.C. on Crete’s Mount Psiloritis, have uncovered two additional complexes that were constructed around 1700 B.C. One of these additions may have served as a religious sanctuary. Last year, the team members uncovered an altar in this area. This year, they found a burnt wooden object surrounded by gold flakes that may have been a statuette covered in gold leaf; a pestle; a seal depicting an animal; and traces of an earlier sanctuary dating back to 1900 B.C. A figurine dubbed the “Lady of Zominthos” was recovered from this earlier sanctuary. The second room, constructed with flagstone floors and both a sophisticated drainage system and a sewage system, contained a seal bearing a flower image dated to 2000 B.C. Pottery at the site indicates it was occupied even before the first palace was built, while a coin issued by the Doge of Venice between 1289 and 1311 attests to Venetian rule of the island during the Fourth Crusade.

Orton explained that it had been previously thought that Neolithic sites outside of the Mediterranean were not heavily populated enough to support the rodents. The bones, from Mus musculus domesticus , or the eastern subspecies of house mouse, are 6,500 years old, thousands of years older than the remains of the western subspecies of mouse uncovered at Bronze Age sites in Greece.

MÉRIDA, SPAIN—According to an El País report, archaeologists Javier Fernández of the Caraca-Driebes Archaeological Team and Emilio Gamo of the National Museum of Roman Art, along with geologists from the Spanish Geological and Mining Institute, reviewed ancient historical accounts and archaeological and geological evidence to attempt to pinpoint the location of the 220 B.C. battle between the 25,000 soldiers and 40 elephants led by the Carthaginian general Hannibal and 100,000 members of the local Carpetani, Vettone, and Olcade tribes. Historical descriptions note that the battle occurred along the Tagus River, which stretches some 625 miles from the mountains of eastern Spain to Portugal’s Atlantic coast. The researchers argue that Hannibal would have chosen to travel to his winter quarters along an ancient route that connected central Spain to the southeast, and would have crossed the Tagus River close to the town of Driebes and the Carpetani-fortified settlement of Caraca. Hannibal is said to have built a defensive wall near the river and placed his cavalry at shallow areas to force the Carpetani to cross in deep, fast-moving waters to avoid his soliders. The researchers note that geologic conditions near Driebes could have preserved the river’s winding course and shallow fords over the past 2,200 years. A survey of the area has also detected traces of a possible man-made structure. Future research will include a search for military artifacts and elephant bones, Gamo said. "

Men’s fingerprint ridges tend to be broader than women’s, and the distance between the ridges grows from childhood to adulthood, the researchers explained. The hand-painted strokes, circles, geometric motifs, and human figures in the cave are estimated to have been created between 4500 and 2000 B.C. Knowledge of who painted the images could help researchers understand their significance, explained Leonardo García Sanjuán of the University of Seville.

KHAKASSIA, RUSSIA— Live Science reports that researchers from Siberia’s Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography discovered the 2,500-year-old remains of a man, a woman, a newborn infant, and an older woman in a grave that also held full-sized bronze daggers, knives, axes, mirrors, and a miniature comb made of animal horn. These nomadic Scythian warriors, who may have been killed by an illness, belonged to the Tagar culture, whose members are known to have buried their dead with miniatures of everyday objects. The man and woman were placed in the grave on their backs next to large ceramic vessels. Two bronze daggers and two axes were also set by the man, while one bronze dagger, one ax, and a hatchet or long-handled ax were placed by the woman’s remains. Oleg Andreevich Mitko of Novosibirsk State University said that Tagarian women were usually buried with long-range weapons such as arrowheads. The older woman, estimated to be about 60 years old at the time of death, was placed on her side with her knees bent at the feet of the other two adults. A small ceramic vessel and a comb with broken teeth was placed next to her. DNA analysis may reveal if the grave’s occupants were related to each other. "

Previous research had shown that the Viking woman, buried with what appears to be a lance or a staff and weighed down with large stones, was the first to die. The remains of her son, who may have been executed, hung, and bound, were later placed in the grave. “We need to look at whether other graves and other source material from the Viking Age could reveal some patterns that might help us solve this case,” said archaeologist Ole Kastholm.

LAHAINA, MAUI—Excavation at the oldest standing home on the Hawaiian island of Maui has uncovered the possible remains of its nineteenth-century kitchen, according to a Maui News report. Now known as the Baldwin Home Museum, the house was built in 1834 out of sand, coral, and lava rock over a timber frame by a physician named the Rev. Dwight Baldwin, who lived there from 1836 to 1868, and is remembered for his work to control a smallpox outbreak in 1853 through the use of quarantine and vaccination. The kitchen was constructed out of adobe bricks on a stone foundation as an outbuilding. Director of the Lahaina Restoration Foundation Theo Morrison said that food prepared in the kitchen would have fed as many as 20 people per day, including the family’s six children, visitors, sea captains, missionaries, and travelers. The archaeologists have unearthed shells of the opihi, a type of edible limpet or aquatic snail; clam shells; animal bones; pieces of porcelain; and a bone button dated to the mid-nineteenth century, Morrison added. The researchers have also found evidence of a fire pit in the backyard that may have been used for cooking and washing. "

UMEÅ, SWEDEN— ZME Science reports that an international team of researchers suggests that wealth inequality among people living in the same community could have originated earlier than previously thought. Chelsea Budd of Umeå University and her colleagues analyzed the 6,600-year-old remains of 30 adults uncovered in a cemetery in Osłonki, Poland. Some of the burials included pendants, headbands, and copper beads, hinting that those individuals had lived with more wealth than those buried without such trinkets. The carbon isotopes in the human bones were then compared with the remains of cattle unearthed in the same region and dated to the same time period. The researchers found that the people who had been buried with trinkets had a distinctive ratio of carbon isotopes in their bones matching that of the local cattle. Meanwhile, the chemical composition of the bones of those people who had been buried without trinkets indicates that they did not feast on beef. The study also found that the cattle had grazed on grasses from sunny, open fields, perhaps because the people who ate them owned the land, the researchers concluded. "

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL—Microscopic examination of five 120,000-year-old clamshells unearthed in Israel’s Qafzeh Cave detected striations around naturally occurring holes near their tops, according to an Ars Technica report. Daniella Bar-Yosef Mayer of Tel Aviv University and her colleagues suggest the marks indicate the shells once hung on a string. Additional wear around the edges of the shells may have been caused by the shells rubbing against each other. Four of the shells also retained traces of red ochre. The team members created their own shell jewelry and experimented with strings made from different kinds of fibers. They found that the marks left by string made with flax matched the marks on the prehistoric shells. Because 160,000-year-old shells from Israel’s Misliya Cave do not carry similar marks, Bar-Yosef Mayer and her colleagues suggest string was invented sometime between 160,000 and 120,000 years ago. The invention of string, she explained, would have led to raft-building, fishing nets, and more complicated animal traps, clothing, and bags. It is still not clear, however, if string was invented by modern humans or Neanderthals, she concluded. "

JALISCO, MEXICO— Mexico News Daily reports that traces of tejuino, a type of beer made from corn, have been detected in the largest of six large urns unearthed in 2008 near the Guachimontones circular pyramids in central-western Mexico. The urns are estimated to be between 500 and 700 years old. Archaeologist Rodrigo Esparza López of the College of Michoacán said chemical analysis of the residues revealed boiled starches from maize and sweet potato, which may have been added to the corn beverage for their high sugar content in order to boost fermentation. The other jars may also have been used to ferment, cook, and store tejuino, or store water or grain, he added. The large vessel was reassembled by students at Mexico’s Western School of Conservation and Restoration (ECRO) over the past 12 years. They found that about 85 percent of it had been preserved, and it weighed about 220 pounds. Full of liquid, the vessel would have weighed more than 400 pounds.

GAMBIER, OHIO— Science News reports that a fragment of string made of twisted inner tree-bark fibers has been found on a stone tool unearthed at a Neanderthal site in southeastern France by Bruce Hardy of Kenyon College and his colleagues. The tool was recovered from sediment dated to between 52,000 and 41,000 years ago in the Abri du Maras rock shelter, where individual twisted fibers had been recovered in the past. Now measuring less than one-quarter of an inch long, the string may have fastened the tool to a handle, or it may have been woven into a bag that held the tool, the researchers explained. Neanderthal string-makers would have had to understand mathematical concepts and the growth cycles of trees, they added. The previously oldest-known piece of string, made of twisted wild flax fibers and dated to about 32,000 years ago, was discovered in western Asia. "

COLERAIN, NORTH CAROLINA— The Charlotte Observer reports that a farmer in North Carolina discovered a Revolutionary War–era site on his land near the Chowan River. Charles Ewen of East Carolina University said the recovered artifacts include broken wine bottles, china, British-made smoking pipes, large ceramic storage vessels, keys, locks, bone-handled utensils, oyster shells, an ornate marble font, and a glass jewel inscribed with the words “Wilkes and Liberty 45” that is identical to a cufflink jewel recently uncovered at a late eighteenth-century tavern site in Brunswick Town. Such jewels were worn to help rebels recognize each other, since the slogan referred to English pamphleteer John Wilkes, whose Pamphlet 45 argued that the English king was not above reproach. “Everything we had found in Brunswick Town, he has found lots more of,” Ewen said. Ewen thinks the site could be another tavern, or possibly a warehouse at a ferry crossing, since the site is situated just 100 yards from the Chowan River. “People stayed a bit at ferry crossings because it took a long time,” he explained. Ballast stones have been found in the rubble, he added. Ewen and his colleagues plan to examine the area with ground-penetrating radar to look for evidence of structures. "

The burial shaft is connected to a mummification workshop and five other burial chambers dated to the 26th Dynasty (688–525 B.C.), which were unearthed in 2018. Four poorly preserved wooden coffins were found in the sixth chamber. Ramadan B. Hussein of the University of Tübingen said one of the coffins belonged to a woman named Didibastett, who was buried with six canopic jars. Ancient Egyptians were usually buried with four canopic jars, Hussein explained, which held the embalmed lungs, stomach, intestines, and liver of the deceased. Computerized tomography scans of Didibastett’s two extra jars suggest they contain as yet unidentified human tissue. Waziri added that chemical analysis of artifacts recovered from the mummification workshop by scientists from the University of Tübingen, the University of Munich, and the Egyptian National Research Center has detected traces of bitumen, cedar oil, cedar resin, pistachio resin, beeswax, animal fat, and possibly olive oil and juniper oil.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8573-200406-australopithecus-afarensis-brains,Pre-Human,"Did Early Human Ancestors Enjoy Long Childhoods?. CHICAGO, ILLINOIS—A new study of fossils from Ethiopia suggests that more than three million years ago, Australopithecus afarensis children needed care for an extended period of time, according to a Science News report. It had been previously thought that the small size of infant heads and an extended period of brain development evolved some 2.5 million years ago, in order to accommodate a pelvis adapted to upright walking in the Homo genus of human ancestors. Philipp Gunz of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and a team of researchers scanned the insides of the skulls of six Australopithecus afarensis adults and two children under the age of three at the time of death with synchrotron-computed tomography to examine imprints left by brains, compute their volume, and see how they were organized. Today, modern human brains have a larger prefrontal cortex, and reach adult size at about the age of five, while the brains of chimpanzees and other apes have a smaller prefrontal cortex and reach adult size between the ages of two or three. The study revealed that the organization of the Australopithecus afarensis brains was similar to that of chimpanzees, but their rate of brain growth was more like that of modern humans. Gunz said such an extended period of childhood brain growth might have lowered an infant’s nutritional requirements, making a child easier for a mother to feed. "

COUNTY MEATH, IRELAND— The Irish Independent reports that archaeologists led by Geraldine Stout have uncovered pottery; the bones of cows, sheep, cats, and dogs; seeds; nuts; a key; a timber dash-urn with a paddle for churning butter; and a bakery at the site of a thirteenth-century monastery in eastern Ireland. The monastery was equipped with a communal latrine, a water system, and a cellar to support between 30 and 50 monks. Previous investigation of the site revealed French jugs and ceramic roof tiles, suggesting the site was inhabited by French Cistercians from Normandy known as De Bello Becco. The monastery also had a gatehouse. “We were lucky to find waterlogged deposits which preserved a lot of timber and seeds for us so we can tell by the flat oats and cereal that the monks made and ate sourdough bread,” Stout said.

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL—According to a Science News report, molecular biologist Oded Rechavi of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues analyzed animal DNA obtained from 26 Dead Sea Scroll fragments in order to study the possible origins of the ancient parchments. After they excluded the DNA left behind by people who handled the scrolls, the researchers determined that two of the fragments were made from cowskin, and the rest were made from sheepskin. Further analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA indicates that eight of the fragments came from closely related sheep, which suggests these documents were all produced in the same place. Previous research of spelling and other elements of the written tradition had indicated that seven of these fragments originated in the Qumran community. Team member Noam Mizrahi pointed out that cows were not raised in the Judean desert, so cowskin scrolls probably originated somewhere other than Qumran. A Qumran fragment from the biblical book of Isaiah was determined to have come from a group of sheep distinct from the Qumran sheep, and so may also have been produced at an unidentified site. "

OSLO, NORWAY— Life in Norway reports that the completed georadar survey of Edoya Island, which is located off the coast of western Norway, has revealed a second Viking ship burial. The first ship burial, now known as the Edoya ship, was detected on the small island last fall. Manuel Gabler of the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) said the data indicates an object about 24 feet long and three feet wide had been placed inside a circular structure thought to be a round stone cairn. NIKU researcher Knut Paasche added that the long object probably represents the bottom of the boat, and the full vessel would have been long enough to have been propelled by four pairs of oars. The survey also detected a round anomaly in the soil that may have been a burial mound that has been plowed over, two more possible graves, and what could be traces of two houses. “The houses that have been traced may well be from the older Iron Age, circa A.D. 300 to 600,” explained county conservator Bjørn Ringstad. “The tombs may be from the younger Iron Age, circa A.D. 600 to 900. The findings nevertheless show that there was a close connection between the residences and the burial ground at Edoya.” The presence of ship burials suggests the island was a seat of Viking power, Paasche added.

In particular, they looked at the animals’ mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosomes, and DNA markers linked to coat color, and found that genetic patterns associated with domestication appeared suddenly in the Anatolian horses around 2000 B.C. If horses had been domesticated in Anatolia, Guimaraes explained, the traits would have been acquired gradually. The imported horses then bred with local wild Anatolian horses and donkeys, producing mules between 1100 and 800 B.C. Horses are more likely to have been domesticated in the Black Sea region, Guimaraes added. "

Toby Driver of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales said the sites offer a glimpse of Rome’s military might during the 20-year fight to conquer Celtic tribes in the region. “This is when Wales is still a very dangerous place to be for the troops, they are still under attack,” he said. One of the forts, located to the west of the Roman town of Caerwent and the Roman legionary fortress at Caerleon, had an inner and an outer defensive structure. The zone in between would have allowed Roman soldiers to attack the enemy with javelins. The Roman marching camp, the third to be identified in Wales, served as a temporary overnight stop with defensive positions and kitchens for soldiers traveling through hostile territory. Once the fighting was over, Driver said, the camps were dismantled. “It’s the scale of the control of Wales which is exciting to see,” he explained. "

It had been previously suggested that the trunk was the center of a religious cult, or that it came from a “tree of life” which symbolized “the center of the world.” Guiterman’s analysis of strontium isotopes in the wood and comparison of its tree rings with those of modern trees suggests it grew more than 50 miles away, in the Chuska Mountains, and not in the center of the ancient town. An examination of records of the initial excavation of Pueblo Bonito also revealed that no evidence of deep tree roots was uncovered in the plaza. Guiterman suggests the tree trunk may have been used by the residents of Pueblo Bonito as a pole, a construction beam, a bench, or even firewood. “I don’t know what it was used for, or why it was located in the plaza where it was found,” he concluded.

Grillo said the ability for adults to digest milk, known as lactase persistence, had been thought to have evolved in East Africa about 4,000 years ago, based upon previous genetic studies and the bones of cattle, sheep, and goats found at archaeological sites. The results of the residue testing yielded the first direct evidence of milk processing in East Africa by ancient pastoralists, Grillo explained. "

EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND—Construction work near the mouth of the Water of Leith revealed traces of the Edinburgh and Leith Glassworks, which was founded in the mid-eighteenth century and demolished in 1912, according to a report in the Edinburgh Evening News . The excavation unearthed remnants of one of the factory’s six huge furnace cones. Each one once stood between 80 and 100 feet tall with a 40-foot diameter base. Traces of buildings such as a workshop and a warehouse were also found. Edinburgh Council archaeologist John Lawson said the glassworks made bottles for French wine, Spanish sherry, and Portuguese port imported in wooden casks and barrels. Locally produced whisky and medicines also created a demand for glass bottles, he explained, until the late nineteenth century, when the glassworks was dissolved, the equipment sold off, and the site was converted to use as a lumber yard.

BRISTOL, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that a team of researchers led by Tamar Hodos of the University of Bristol used scanning electron microscopy to analyze the chemical makeup of 5,000-year-old decorated ostrich eggs discovered in burials in Italy and held at the British Museum. The researchers then compared the levels of elements in the ancient eggshells, which were decorated with carvings, paint, ivory, precious metals, and small glazed stones, with modern ostrich eggshells from Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Turkey. As a result, Hodos and her colleagues were able to determine which ancient eggs were laid in a cooler and wetter climate, or a hotter and drier one. Hodos said eggshells from both types of climate areas were found at sites in each zone, indicating that they had been carried along extensive trade routes. She also thinks that the eggs had been taken from dangerous wild birds, and were then stored until they were dry enough to decorate, adding to their overall value. The researchers were not able to recreate the elaborate decorations on the eggs, however. "

It had been previously thought that the well-preserved remains belonged to a prepubescent male warrior, based upon the array of weapons in the grave and the lack of beads and mirrors typically recovered from female burials. “This discrepancy in the norms of the funeral rite received an unexpected explanation: firstly, the young man turned out to be a girl, and this young ‘Amazon’ had not yet reached the age of 14 years,” said excavator Marina Kilunovskaya of the St. Petersburg Institute of Material History Culture. The body, dressed in a long fur coat, a shirt, trousers or a skirt, and a leather cap decorated with a red spiral, was accompanied by a bow made of birch, a quiver containing ten arrows with wood, bone, or bronze tips, and an ax. “This opens up a new aspect in the study of the social history of Scythian society and involuntarily returns us to the myth of the Amazons that survived thanks to [the Greek historian] Herodotus,” Kilunovskaya added.

In a nineteenth-century survey compiled from information provided by local ministers of the Church of Scotland, the site was described as a stronghold used by William Wallace, who fought for Scottish independence from the English in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Ritchie said the team members used a drone to take hundreds of photographs of the site, and combined them with computer software to create a 3-D model of the terrain. “There isn’t much evidence on the surface, but the rampart and topography matches the historic description very well,” he said. “But could the fort really have been built by William Wallace and his men?” Ritchie asked. “I’d like to think so—and either way, the survey has added a new chapter to an old story.” "

BOLOGNA, ITALY—According to a Live Science report, Maria Giovanna Belcastro of the University of Bologna and her colleagues suggest a battered 5,600-year-old skull recovered from a deep cave shaft in northern Italy may have been washed there with mud and water flowing toward a sinkhole from a separate burial site. Analysis of lesions on the skull with a CT scan indicate that it had been deliberately removed from the body, and its soft tissues scraped away, a funerary practice observed in other Neolithic burials in the region. The skull is thought to have belonged to a woman who was between the ages of 24 and 35 at the time of death. Other marks on the skull suggest she had suffered a head wound that had healed. Grooves below this wound may have may been made with tools during a surgical procedure. Red ochre on the skull may have been placed there as a medicine or for symbolic reasons, the scientists explained. Tiny holes in the bone may be related to inflammation from chronic anemia, and two dense spots are thought to be benign tumors. Finally, possible childhood health problems are recorded in her underdeveloped tooth enamel, while several dental cavities suggest she ate a diet high in carbohydrates."

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA—According to a statement released by the University of the Witwatersrand , Amélie Beaudet and her colleagues examined high-resolution microcomputer tomography scans of a 3.67 million-year-old fossilized skull and first cervical vertebra recovered from South Africa’s Sterkfontein cave system. The bones are part of a nearly complete Australopithecus skeleton known as “Little Foot.” The study suggests that the hominin moved its head in a manner consistent with tree-climbing ability. The well-preserved fossils also offer information about the size of arteries that passed through the vertebra, and thus the amount of blood flow to the brain. Little Foot’s blood flow is estimated to resemble the blood flow observed in modern chimpanzees, or about three times lower than in modern humans. Beaudet said the low blood flow to the brain could reflect the individual’s small brain size, a poor-quality diet, or a need for energy in another part of the Australopithecus anatomy. Increased blood flow to the brain is thought to have emerged much later in human evolution, she added. "

OSLO, NORWAY—According to a Science Norway report, Svein Vatsvåg Nielsen of the University of Oslo examined bluefin tuna and killer whale bones and bone fishhooks and harpoons discovered in a southern Norway wetland in the 1930s. He determined that the bones and the artifacts date to the same period, from about 3700 to 2500 B.C., a time when sea levels were higher and the place where the items were found may have been covered by a lagoon. Nielsen and his colleagues returned to the site, which had since been drained, and uncovered the ancient seabed and piles of bluefin tuna bones, cod bones, small whale bones, arrowheads, fishhooks, and harpoons. The researchers suggest that while hunting large fish from boats, some of the prey may have been injured but not recovered by the hunters, or may be the remains of fish that were cleaned in the boats and thrown overboard. “It would be an incredible coincidence if these rare harpoons and fish bones were just randomly collected there,” Nielsen explained. The study also indicates that prehistoric people fished in the lagoon over a long period of time. Further study of the area may result in evidence of a settlement, Nielsen added. "

NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND—According to a BBC News report, research conducted by Hannah Durkin of Newcastle University has identified Matilda McCrear as one of the last survivors of the transatlantic slave trade. Captured by slave traders in West Africa at the age of two, McCrear arrived in Alabama on the slave ship Clotilda in 1860. The ship is thought to have been scuttled shortly after its arrival in Mobile Bay in an effort to destroy evidence of the journey, because the importation of slaves to the United States had been outlawed in 1808. McCrear, her mother, and one of her three sisters who made the journey were purchased by the same plantation owner, Memorable Walker Creagh. After the abolition of slavery in the United States in 1865, the family worked as sharecroppers. Durkin said McCrear changed her surname, and had a common-law marriage with a white German-born man. They had 14 children. At the age of 70, McCrear was interviewed by the Selma Times-Journal after she and Sally “Redoshi” Smith, another Clotilda survivor, made a claim for compensation for their enslavement at the county courthouse, which was dismissed. McCrear died in Selma, Alabama, in January of 1940. Sally “Redoshi” Smith died in 1937, and Oluale Kossala, also known as Cudjo Lewis, another known Clotilda survivor, died in 1935. "

LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA—Archaeologist Debby Sneed of California State University, Long Beach, says that evidence of ramps for use by the disabled has largely been overlooked at ancient Greek temples, according to a Science Magazine report. Sneed looked for evidence of ramps in published excavation reports and visited ancient Greek sanctuaries, focusing on fourth-century B.C. sites dedicated to Asclepius, the Greek god of healing. Sneed said she found evidence of ramps at some sanctuaries that had not been included in excavation reports. For example, Sneed totaled 11 ramps at the main Asclepius sanctuary complex at Epidaurus. A broad stone ramp led to the main temple, while two additional ramps led through the sanctuary gates. Smaller side buildings at the site were also equipped with ramps wide enough for a single walker. The ramps, Sneed explained, would have made it easier for people who walked with crutches or canes, and would also have aided those who were carrying disabled individuals on litters or stretchers. In contrast, she added, just two ramps were found at the massive Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. “The distribution is pretty clear: They show up in places where there are more disabled people,” Sneed concluded.

They found that a man who was buried some 5,200 years ago in eastern Ireland’s Newgrange passage tomb, the largest of the structures in the study, carried a large number of identical versions of the same genes, indicating he was the son of either a brother and sister or a parent and child. This evidence of incest could be a sign that the society was ruled by an extreme hierarchy that sanctioned royal inbreeding, Cassidy explained.

In addition, few of the individuals shared kinship ties. Wear and tear on the bones of the lower body also shows that some of the dead had been used to carrying heavy loads. “The picture that is emerging does not necessarily correspond to the picture of a warrior, but rather to the picture of people who spent their lives transporting things,” said Detlef Jantzen, chief archaeologist for the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. The remains of women have also been found among the bones, in addition to gold rings, cylinders made of bronze, and glass beads from Egypt and Mesopotamia.

Archaeologist Elena Kogen-Zehavi said the large, pillared structure where the olive oil–based soap was made dates to the Islamic Abbasid period, after the Arab conquest of the region. Turning olive oil and the ashes of the saltwort plant into hard cakes of soap was a complicated process, she explained. First, the liquid mixture was cooked for about seven days, and was then transferred to a shallow pool, where the soap hardened for another ten days, until it could be cut into bars, which dried for another two months. So much soap could have been produced at the site, Kogen-Zehavi added, that it was probably exported to Egypt and other parts of the Arab world. "

Made by rolling wet clay into “snakes” that were then coiled and smoothed into the desired shape, the pots would have been covered with fingerprints, unless they had been wiped away by the potter with a rag before the pot was baked in a kiln. Forensic scientist Lior Nedivi said that women usually have smaller fingertips than men, with denser fingerprint ridges. The breadth of the ridges increases during puberty and stops at about age 20. Thus, analysis of the surviving fingerprints on the pots indicates that most of them were crafted by individual men, although women contributed to the production of some big jars. The study also suggests that there was a pottery school at the site, where multiple people, including children, handled “training pots.” Critics point out that pots shrink when fired, which would change the size any fingerprints left on the surface.

The Ladies’ Cottage closed in 2000. “Their families generally would pay for them to be in the facilities and get a slightly better level of care, what was thought appropriate for their social class,” Bryant said. Many of the patients cared for in the Ladies’ Cottage were elderly and had dementia, she added, but Bryant’s review of patient records revealed that the residents suffered from a wide range of symptoms of mental illness. Most of the objects she found under the verandah date to the World War II era and include pieces of embroidery made from an apron or tea towel and newspaper and book clippings.

LEIPZIG, GERMANY—According to a Science Magazine report, Martin Petr and Janet Kelso of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and their colleagues analyzed the Y chromosomes of three Neanderthal men who lived between 38,000 and 53,000 years ago, and whose remains were recovered in Belgium, Spain, and Russia, and the Y chromosomes of two male Denisovans who lived in Siberia between 46,000 and 130,000 years ago. The researchers determined that the genetic material on the Neanderthal Y more closely resembles a modern human Y chromosome than that of their close Denisovan cousins. Computational models based upon this information indicate the modern human Y chromosome spread rapidly from father to son through the small Neanderthal populations in Europe and Asia between 100,000 and 370,000 years ago. However, the researchers note, this Y chromosome came from a modern human population that migrated out of Africa and then went extinct. Kelso explained that the modern human Y chromosome may have offered Neanderthals a genetic advantage, especially after modern human mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child, entered Neanderthal populations some 220,000 years ago. The team members will now try to obtain samples of older Neanderthal Y chromosomes to see if they more closely resemble Denisovan DNA. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8956-200814-europe-syphilis-dna,Medieval,"DNA Study Tracks Europe's Medieval Syphilis Epidemic. ZÜRICH, SWITZERLAND— Science Magazine reports that a new study of DNA samples extracted from the remains of people buried in Finland, Estonia, and the Netherlands suggests that several diverse strains of syphilis were circulating in Europe in the late fifteenth century. It had been previously thought that Treponema pallidum , the bacterium that causes the disease, was introduced to Europe by Christopher Columbus and his crew upon their return from the New World in 1493. Verena Schuenemann of the University of Zürich and her colleagues looked for bacterial DNA in the remains of nine Europeans whose skeletons bore bone lesions associated with syphilis. They were able to recover bacterial DNA from four of them. The researchers then compared the DNA with modern syphilis to track the changes in the genome and estimate the ages of the strains, calibrated with carbon dates of the skeletons and their wooden coffins. They found evidence of a previously unidentified strain of syphilis, and dated two other strains to the early to mid-fifteenth century. They also detected evidence of yaws, another disease caused by the bacterium which is found today only in the tropics. “Either Columbus brought a whole bouquet of strains, or this diversity was present there before,” said archaeogeneticist Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. He acknowledges that additional samples and more precise dates are necessary to confirm the presence of syphilis in the Old World prior to Columbus’s travels. "

ONTARIO, CANADA—According to a statement released by the University of Toronto Mississauga , Kalyan Sekhar Chakraborty analyzed residues in pottery from the site of Kotada Bhadli, which is located near India’s western coast, and found that dairy products may have been produced by members of the Indus Valley civilization on a large scale as early as 2500 B.C. The chemical analysis also indicates that the dairy animals were fed millet. Chakraborty suggests that the animal protein provided by dairy products may have helped to sustain the large population that lived in the Indus Valley, and perhaps provided a surplus for trade, without affecting the number of animals in a herd.

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL—According to a Haaretz report, Gil Haklay of the Israel Antiquities Authority and Avi Gopher of Tel Aviv University employed a computer algorithm to analyze the design of Göbekli Tepe, a temple complex in southeastern Anatolia thought to have been built by hunter gatherers some 11,500 years ago. The complex includes concentric, roughly circular structures featuring pairs of pillars set in the centers of the circles, Haklay said. It had been previously suggested that all of the structures were built over time, but Haklay and Gopher suggest the construction of the oldest buildings at the site was planned as a single project. The analysis revealed, Haklay explained, that the centers of three of the stone circles were placed roughly midway between their central pillars. Those three points, when linked, are within about ten inches of forming an equilateral triangle with sides measuring about 63 feet long. “The enclosures all have different sizes and shapes so the odds that these center points would form an equilateral triangle by chance are very low,” he said. Gopher added that the project would have required the labor of at least hundreds of people and could mark the beginnings of stratified society. "

The animals are thought to have died trapped in the marshy soil of an ancient lake bed between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago. Humans may have driven the animals into the mud, or traveled to the site to scavenge the carcasses for food and materials for tools and weapons.

The tomb’s long, narrow passageway, which is aligned with the setting sun of the winter solstice, leads to a large, central chamber. Van der Reijden says the manner of the construction of the three side chambers, where the dead were laid to rest, suggests the rooms were situated in the underworld. “Visualize the wall-stones are like wallpapers, and when you repeatedly hang them upside down in distinct locations patterns become discernible,” she said. “The swaps include the reversal of multiple architectural features normally placed on the righthand side being on the left only inside the side chambers.” In this scenario, the walls of the main chamber separate this life from the afterlife, which is represented by the side chambers. Placing the dead in these rooms may have facilitated their passage to the netherworld, van der Reijden explained. "

PRAIRIE GROVE, ARKANSAS— The Arkansas Democrat Gazette reports that archaeologists from the Arkansas Archaeological Survey and the University of Arkansas are conducting a survey of the Prairie Grove Battlefield. On December 7, 1862, Union troops engaged Confederate troops that had set up a defensive position at a farm owned by Archibald Borden. More than 2,500 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed in the ensuing battle, and although the fighting was tactically indecisive, the Confederates withdrew from the position, and the Union gained control of northwestern Arkansas. Matt Mulheran, a park interpreter at Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park, said that before archaeologists could begin the survey, six acres of park land around Borden House were cleared of trees and underbrush to re-create the historic landscape. Michael Evans of the University of Arkansas added that archaeologists have to determine which artifacts at the site date to the Civil War, and which were left behind by Civil War reenactors and the television production The Blue and the Gray , which filmed at the site in the early 1980s. Evans explained that so far, the researchers have found nineteenth-century objects, including bullets and artillery shells, in unexpected places. “I’m looking forward to how it may rewrite the narrative of the battle,” he said.

The objects were discovered in the lake in 2007, and were kept in similar underwater conditions for the past 13 years while they were studied. Most of the 52 possible ritual items in the collection are spherical or conical in shape and made of the resin of the copal tree. The conical artifacts measure between eight and 12 inches tall, and may have been intended to resemble the volcano, according to INAH archaeologist Iris Hernández. The spherical objects are about the size of a baseball, she added. Carbon dating of the objects indicates they were made between A.D. 1216 and 1445, when the Matlatzinca people ruled the Valley of Toluca. INAH researcher Enna Llabrés Torres said that returning the artifacts to their place of origin for preservation complies with the 2001 recommendation made by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage.

The researchers then tested the recreated monument in a sound laboratory, just as models of concert halls and opera houses are tested. The study suggests that the strong reverberations of instruments such as drums and lurs, a kind of bronze horn, would have been amplified between ten and 20 percent when played in the monument’s inner sanctum. But these sounds would have been less audible to anyone outside the circle, Cox added, even without a roof on the structure. “With so many stones missing or displaced, the modern acoustics of Stonehenge are very different to that in prehistory,” he explained.

HAIFA, ISRAEL—According to a Live Science report, an examination of the bones of lizards and snakes recovered from el-Wad Terrace, a cave near Mount Carmel in northern Israel, indicates that reptiles such as the legless European glass lizard and the large whip snake were eaten by members of the Natufian culture at the site between 15,000 and 11,500 years ago. The lizard and snake bones made up about one-third of the animal bones in the cave. Ma’ayan Lev of the University of Haifa said that finding butchery marks on such small bones can be difficult, especially when they have been weathered over a long period of time. Lev and her colleagues therefore experimented with the bones of modern lizards and snakes to identify signs of erosion, burning, trampling, and digestion by birds of prey, and then compared those marks with marks on the ancient remains. “The most surprising find was the butchery marks on several large whip snake vertebrae,” Lev said, adding that the marks were found in identical locations of different bones. These animals were likely eaten by humans, Lev said. The study also suggests the eastern Montpellier snake, the common viper, and other smaller lizards and snakes whose remains were found in the cave were likely eaten by raptors or died of other causes.

BURGOS, SPAIN—Paleobiologist Daniel García-Martínez of Spain’s National Research Center on Human Evolution and his colleagues suggest that Neanderthal babies were born with inward-curving spines and short, barrel-shaped chests to accommodate their large lungs, according to a Science News report. These characteristics had previously only been noted in Neanderthal adults. To see if Neanderthal children shared the same stocky build or developed it as they grew, the researchers digitally reconstructed the rib cages of four Neanderthal children ranging in age from a couple of weeks to 2.5 years old. Their partial skeletons were found in France, Syria, and Russia, and dated to between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. “The stocky body shape of Neanderthals not only passed from parents to children, but also probably passed from ancestral species to their Neanderthal descendants,” García-Martínez concluded. This stocky build may have been inherited from Homo erectus , he added. Modern humans may have therefore evolved their longer legs, flatter rib cages, and other identifying features after the split from Neanderthals, by about 300,000 years ago. "

The settlement is located more than a mile inland from the coast. Climate change during the Little Ice Age, a period of cooler temperatures between 1645 and 1715, may have contributed to the accumulation of sand. Scientists have also suggested that the people who lived on the island wiped out its natural protective dune system through oat farming, or that it might have been destroyed by burrowing rabbits. Bigelow and his team found that someone constructed a staircase over mounds of sand in order to create an entrance into a submerged outbuilding. “You would have to climb out of your house onto the landscape that keeps rising,” Bigelow said. “They did not abandon the house until the sand reached the eaves of the roof.” "

STOKE-ON-TRENT, ENGLAND—According to a Live Science report, researchers led by Caroline Sturdy Colls of Staffordshire University investigated the site of Sylt, the forced labor camp built by the Nazis on the Channel Island of Alderney in 1942. Designed to hold 100 to 200 people, the camp was first used to detain political prisoners and then as a concentration camp. By 1943 more than 1,000 people were imprisoned at the camp. The Nazis closed the camp in 1944 and systematically destroyed many of its records. The researchers surveyed the site with remote-sensing technology and examined the surviving vegetation-covered structures. They found that the prisoners’ barracks offered only five feet of space per person, and would have offered little protection from wind and cold, in contrast to buildings occupied by Nazi guards, which were constructed with reinforced concrete and stone to withstand air raids. Mass graves on the island are thought to contain the remains of at least 700 people who died at Sylt. "

The study suggests that the genetic difference between ancient modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans was so small that their hybrid offspring would have likely been healthy and fertile, explaining the presence of traces of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in the modern human genome today. The researchers found that the greater the evolutionary distance between two mammal species, the less likely the match is to produce fertile offspring. Overall, the genetic distance values between early modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans were smaller than those recorded between polar bears and brown bears, which are known to produce healthy, fertile young.

ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA— Cosmos Magazine reports that a team of researchers, including representatives of the traditional Marra people and archaeologist Liam Brady of Flinders University, investigated how miniature stencils in the Yilbilinji rock shelter in northern Australia’s Limmen National Park might have been created. According to the researchers, the images, which include human figures, crabs, turtles, kangaroo paws, an echidna, boomerangs, and geometric shapes, have curved edges, and are too small to have been made by tracing objects or body parts. Monash University anthropologist John Bradley suggested that the rounded edges may have been formed with molded beeswax stuck to the surface of the rock, since people living in the region continue to use the substance to repair tools and make toys. “Our experiments involving heating and shaping beeswax into human figures, animals, objects, and geometric shapes, and then stenciling onto a rock slab confirmed beeswax was an excellent material for making miniature stencils,” Bradley said. Similar artworks have been found in New South Wales, Australia, and Kisar Island, Indonesia, but those artworks only depict human figures. "

CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA—According to a statement released by Australian National University , a study of artifacts unearthed in caves on the northeastern Indonesian island of Obi suggests that seafaring people reached the island at least 18,000 years ago, when the climate was drier and cooler, and sea levels were lower, making the island much larger than it is today. Among the objects recovered from the caves were 11,700-year-old stone axes, and fragments of 14,000-year-old axes made of clam shells. Similar objects were traditionally used by people in the region to create dugout canoes. Researchers led by Shimona Kealy and Sue O’Connor suggest that these tools may have been used by early island inhabitants for clearing forest undergrowth and carving dugout canoes for transport between islands. Other objects that indicate that Obi’s residents enjoyed contact with people from other islands include pieces of obsidian, since there is no known source of volcanic glass on the island, and shell beads that are similar to those found on islands to the south. Obi is thought to have been abandoned about 8,000 years ago, perhaps because the jungle undergrowth became too thick to manage for hunting and other activities as the climate warmed. "

C. Trevor Duke and his colleagues Thomas Pluckhahn of the University of South Florida and J. Matthew Compton of Georgia Southern University compared animal remains from Roberts Island with those found at an older ceremonial site about one mile away at Crystal River. The researchers said that both of these sites were continually occupied by a small group of locals who likely prepared for visitors. Feasters are thought to have traveled to Crystal River to conduct religious ceremonies and ritual burials containing distinctly decorated ceramics, arrange marriage alliances, and enjoy meals of deer, alligator, shark, and other delicacies. In contrast, those who later gathered at Roberts Island ate mostly oysters, perhaps reflecting lower sea levels and cooler, dryer conditions.

Tools at the site are thought to have been crafted by the human ancestor Homo erectus . The study suggests that the ax's oval shape was crafted by striking off the leg bone with one blow from a stone or bone hammer, and then chipped into its final shape with additional blows. Wear on the ax indicates it was used to cut or saw. The researchers explained that when combined with the variety of stone tools recovered from other Homo erectus sites in East Africa, the bone hand ax suggests that Homo erectus technology could have been more sophisticated and versatile than previously thought.

If correct, the discovery indicates that people arrived in North America at least 15,000 years earlier than previously thought. Ardelean thinks the well-insulated cave probably offered occasional shelter to early North Americans. “There must have been horrible storms, hail, snow,” he said. Critics point out that the tools may have landed in deeper cave layers through geologic activity or burrowing animals, but Ardelean explained that the oldest tools were found under an intact layer of mud. These artifacts, he added, have marks that suggest they were made by students learning to make tools from experts. And although tests of dirt in the cave failed to detect any ancient human DNA, and studies of modern genomes have not found genetic evidence of people living in North America more than 15,000 years ago, Ardelean said that such early groups did not survive to contribute genes to today’s populations.

Fine ceramics and pieces of gold jewelry were also found in the building. It may have served as a residence for nobles, Aladzhov explained. Servants are thought to have lived near the monumental building in dugout structures lined with stone. “During the winter, it gets really cold and windy here, and when you are ‘dug in’ the ground, that is a natural shelter, and the soil itself helps preserve the heat,” Aladzhov added.

Known as watercourts, the pens, made of oyster shells and sediment, opened into the canal which bisects the island. The researchers suggest that once a school of fish had been driven from the canal into a watercourt, the pen could have been closed off with a gate or a net. Fish bones and scales at the site suggest mullet, pinfish, and herring were among the catch. Evidence of fires and post molds near the structures may be the remains of racks for drying and smoking fish. Geologist Michael Savarese of Florida Gulf Coast University said that the amount of organic material in the soil indicates that the watercourses had poor water circulation, and were probably only used for short-term storage while the catch was processed. Such fishing practices would have allowed the Calusa to create a surplus of food to feed large numbers of workers who were otherwise occupied with the construction of canals, shell islands, and large buildings, the researchers explained.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8556-200331-lene-hara-cave,Paleolithic,"Possible Pleistocene Rock Art Discovered in East Timor. SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND—According to a Cosmos Magazine report, Christopher Standish of the University of Southampton and his colleagues have found traces of poorly preserved hand stencils and pigment splatters in the Lene Hara Cave, which is located on the eastern side of the island of Timor. Standish said the paintings, which probably date to the Pleistocene, were made by blowing red pigment over a hand placed on a mineral crust. The mineral crust has since flaked off the cave walls, leaving behind faint patterns only visible through enhanced photography. It had been previously suggested that all known rock art in East Timor dated to the Holocene, which began about 11,650 years ago, but Standish and his team members note the stylistic differences between the stencils and other images on the cave walls. The later paintings feature geometric shapes and images of animals, and in one case, had been painted over an older hand stencil, he explained. The researchers suggest that migrants traveling by water some 65,000 years ago may have stopped at the site before arriving in Sahul, the ancient landmass made up of what are now Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea. “The rock art we uncovered could be critical for understanding the colonization and spread of ideas between Asia and Sahul,” Standish said.

PARIS, FRANCE—According to a report in The Guardian , human bones have been found in the walls of the Chapelle Expiatoire, a monument dedicated to the memory of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, who were guillotined in 1793 at the Place de la Révolution and buried in the nearby Madeleine cemetery. Aymeric Peniguet de Stoutz, administrator of the chapel, which was completed in 1826 on the site of the Madeleine cemetery, found anomalies in the walls between the columns of the building’s lower chapel. When archaeologist Philippe Charlier inserted a camera through stones in those walls, he spotted four wood and leather ossuaries, human bones, and earth. It had been previously thought that the remains of as many as 500 aristocrats and out-of-favor revolutionaries beheaded during the French Revolution had been transferred from the Madeleine cemetery to another burial site or to catacombs when construction on the Chapelle Expiatoire began. “Until now, the chapel served only as a monument to the memory of the royal family, but we have just discovered that it is also a necropolis of the revolution,” Peniguet de Stoutz said.

NOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND—Analysis of an ice core from the Colle Gnifetti glacier in the Swiss-Italian Alps by Christopher Loveluck of Nottingham University and his colleagues suggests that a spike in the amount of lead in the air can be linked to the late twelfth-century death of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, according to a BBC News report. Atmospheric modeling indicates that the lead in the ice core was carried to the European Alps on winds from British mines, and tax records show that in the late twelfth century, lead and silver were mined in England’s Peak District and in Cumbria. Becket was assassinated by four knights in 1170 after a disagreement with King Henry II over the powers of the church. “To get himself out of jail with the Pope, Henry promised to endow and build a lot of major monastic institutions very, very quickly,” Loveluck said. The massive amount of lead used to roof the monasteries is reflected in the amount of pollution in the ice core, he explained. The level of lead in the atmosphere at the time was similar to the amount of pollution recorded in the Industrial Revolution of the late nineteenth century, he added. "

Archaeologist Kenneth Tankersley said the crystalline quartz and zeolite detected in the reservoir’s sediments had been transported some 18 miles from the ridges around the Bajo de Azúcar. The Maya probably observed that the water bleeding out of these cliffs was clean and sweet, and associated it with the ridges’ exposed volcanic tuff, added researcher Christopher Carr. Tankersley said the Maya’s system would have removed microbes, nitrogen-rich compounds, heavy metals, and other toxins to produce pools of clean water. "

BRISTOL, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that researchers from the University of Bristol radiocarbon dated Bronze Age human remains and artifacts made of human bone and examined them with micro-computed tomography. The radiocarbon dates suggest that many of the bone artifacts belonged to contemporaries of the grave occupants, while the micro-computer tomography scans revealed that some of the bone artifacts came from cremated remains, some of the bones had been exhumed after burial, and other came from bodies that were allowed to decompose on the surface of the ground. Thomas Booth of the University of Bristol said the varied treatment of the remains indicates there was no established protocol for the treatment of bodies whose bones would be preserved as keepsakes. These people may have been played an important role in the community, or they may have been family members, friends, or even enemies. The artifacts may have served as relics to remember individuals within living memory, or as aids to telling stories about them. For example, a human thigh bone that had been carved and polished into a musical instrument was recovered from a grave at a Bronze Age archaeological site near Stonehenge. "

Celal Şimşek of Pamukkale University said the structure was used as a home, as a place of business, and as a Christian church. “The hall in the west was organized for men and the one in the east for women and a place of worship was made here in the east hall,” he said. The eastern hall faced north and was decorated with marble coverings on the walls, he added. “We think that the Laodicea Church was built after Christianity was made free, [in the late fourth century A.D.], and the high-ranking clergy there probably lived in this house, but we have not yet made a clear determination regarding this,” Şimşek said. The building could help researchers understand how Christianity spread throughout the region, he explained. "

MOTALA, SWEDEN— Live Science reports that forensic artist Oscar Nilsson has created a 3-D reconstruction of the head of a Mesolithic man whose 8,000-year-old skull was found among the remains of at least ten other adults and an infant in what was once a lake in eastern-central Sweden. Only one of the skulls was found with a jaw, although the jaws of wild brown bears, boar, red deer, moose, and roe deer were recovered at the site. Two of the skulls had been placed on stakes that rose above the surface of the lake. To create the bust, Nilsson first used data from a computed tomography scan of the man’s skull to print a 3-D replica of it, and then used forensic methods to estimate his weight, height, and age. He reconstructed the man’s missing jaw through skull measurements. The image also shows a head wound with some signs of healing found on the man’s skull. Genetic study of the remains indicates the man had blue eyes, brown hair, and pale skin. Finally, Nilsson depicted the man wearing a wild boar skin based upon the animal jaw found at the site. “We can see from how the human skulls and animal jaws were found that they clearly meant a big deal in their cultural and religious beliefs,” he explained.

The site, known as Ytre Fosse, is located on the sea route connecting northern and southern Norway, and contains multiple cremation burials. The almost-intact elongated dice and 18 game pieces, which have been dated to around A.D. 300, were found among pottery fragments and pieces of burnt glass.

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK— Science Magazine reports that geneticist Enrico Cappellini of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues used mass spectrometry to analyze proteins extracted from a sample of Homo antecessor tooth enamel. The remains of this H. antecessor individual, recovered from northern Spain’s Gran Dolina Cave, have been dated to 800,000 years ago. H. antecessor is known for its large teeth, which seem primitive for its more modern human–like face shape, and has been considered as a possible last common ancestor of modern humans and other archaic humans. Cappellini and his team were able to identify seven proteins in the tooth enamel and determined the individual was male. Comparison of the protein sequences with living apes, modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans suggest that H. antecessor was closely related to the last common ancestor of modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans. “We see that antecessor falls as a sister group—close, very close—to the branch that leads to us,” Cappellini said.

FORT COLLINS, COLORADO—According to a Science News report, biological anthropologist Michael Pante of Colorado State University and his colleagues found an 800,000-year-old barbed point among 52 animal bones recovered from East Africa’s Olduvai Gorge in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The unfinished implement, which features three curved barbs and a carved tip, was crafted from a piece of a large animal’s rib. The set of animal bones also included choppers, hammering tools, and hammering platforms. These tools are similar to those found at other sites with Homo erectus fossils, and are therefore thought to have been made by Homo erectus . But because the barbed bone point is unfinished, it is unclear how the hominins might have used it. It had been previously thought that barbed bone points were first made by Homo sapiens some 90,000 years ago, based upon artifacts uncovered in central Africa. The bases of these finished weapons suggest they had been attached to wooden shafts, perhaps to catch fish and hunt larger land animals. "

BILOXI, MISSISSIPPI— The News & Observer reports that a Mississippi man will donate a bow that he discovered in a creek on his property to the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Scott Summerlin at first thought the 42-inch-long bow was a stick poking out of the creek bed, but he soon realized the object had been shaped and engraved with an image of a deer head and a cat-like animal. Summerlin said an indentation of a thumb in the bow's wood indicates the bearer was right-handed. Experts from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, The Cobb Institute of Archaeology, and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, which once lived in Mississippi, have examined photographs of the bow and believe it is between 300 and 500 years old. “This is something that was probably lost, floated down the creek, got water logged and sank,” said James Starnes of the Mississippi Office of Geology. “It was then covered with mud.” Starnes explained that the tannin-rich water in the stream helped to preserve the rare wooden object in Mississippi’s hot, humid climate. “It belongs to the Choctaw and they should get it back,” Summerlin concluded.

When the engravings were discovered in the 1990s and early 2000s, the images were thought to be between 8,000 and 10,000 years old, and researchers were not sure if they depicted extinct or imagined creatures. The new study identified an additional image of a woolly rhinoceros and a baby woolly mammoth, which went extinct some 15,000 years ago. The images were also shown to have been made with stone implements. In addition, the patina on the stones indicates the images are older than previously thought. The international team of researchers concluded the images in the two locations had been drawn in the so-called Kalgutinsky style, which dates to the Upper Paleolithic period. "

Bochaton said that the remains of many other snake species were found at the sites, but these were the only boa remains, and the only snake bones to have been made into beads, based upon his microscopic evaluation. This suggests the constrictors were given prominent status within Pre-Columbian Amerindian communities, as reflected in a seventeenth-century chronicle of a voyage to the Caribbean known as Carpentras Anonymous , which describes the unwillingness of the island inhabitants to kill boas. Such revered status could account for the scarcity of boa remains in the archaeological record, Bochaton explained. "

Bones from at least 14 mammoths, some of which had been butchered, were recovered from those pits last year. Archaeologist Pedro Sánchez Nava of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History said there could be hundreds of sets of mammoth remains at the newly discovered site, which is set along the shores of an ancient, shallow lake that would have provided the animals with abundant grasses and reeds. Sánchez Nava said the animals may have gotten stuck in deep mud on the lake shore and died. Further study of the remains will look for indications that humans scavenged the carcasses. “It’s possible they may have chased them into the mud,” Sánchez Nava said.

RENO, NEVADA—According to a statement released by the Desert Research Institute , Joe McConnell of the Desert Research Institute, Michael Sigl of the University of Bern, and an international team of their colleagues found evidence of two volcanic eruptions in Arctic ice cores that may have contributed to the fall of the Roman Republic and Egypt’s Ptolemaic Kingdom. Two years of fallout from the eruptions are thought to have triggered the extreme drop in temperatures and increase in rainfall experienced in the Mediterranean world at that time. Archaeologist Andrew Wilson of the University of Oxford explained that the change in weather would have probably reduced crop yields and increased transportation difficulties, possibly contributing to the famine and disease described by ancient sources. Atmospheric phenomena described as omens at the time of the assassination of Julius Caesar may have been caused by the eruption of Sicily’s Mt. Etna in 44 B.C., while analysis of ash from a second, massive event determined that it came from a 43 B.C. eruption of the Okmok II volcano, which is located on Alaska’s Umnak Island.

BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA—According to a statement released by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) , a team of researchers led by Axel Timmermann of the IBS Center for Climate Physics created a supercomputer model to simulate possible scenarios for the collapse of Neanderthal populations between 38,000 and 43,000 years ago. The migration of Neanderthals and modern humans, their interactions and interbreeding, and the rapidly fluctuating climate of the period were all taken into account, Timmermann said. The results produced by the computer model were then compared with anthropological, genetic, and archaeological data. The scientists concluded that competition with modern humans alone was responsible for the extinction of the Neanderthals. Possible reasons for the modern human advantage may have been better hunting techniques, stronger immune systems, or higher birth rates, Timmermann added, while pointing out that Neanderthals survived in Eurasia for 300,000 years only to go extinct around the same time that modern humans arrived on the scene.

PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND—According to a statement released by Brown University , graduate students Alex Marko, Dan Plekhov, and Miriam Rothenberg assembled an interactive map of God’s Little Acre, an African American burial ground in Newport, Rhode Island. The cemetery, in use between 1720 and 1990, holds the remains of generations of free and enslaved people, some of whom were born in Africa. The map, created using 3-D photogrammetry and images captured through the use of a drone, will be linked to a database of information engraved on headstones, which can include the names of the deceased, birth and death years, the names of relatives, epitaphs, and occupations. Such information is rarely available for enslaved people, who were not recorded during the census in early Newport history. Marko said that the project, when completed, will be available to the public, and will allow anyone to search the cemetery for information about a particular family or for people who died during a particular year. The map will also allow users to see how the cemetery evolved over time. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8712-200522-germany-scavenged-elephant,Pre-Human,"300,000-Year-Old Scavenged Elephant Found in Germany. SCHÖNINGEN, GERMANY— Live Science reports that a nearly complete 300,000-year-old elephant skeleton ( Palaeoloxodon antiquus ) has been unearthed near the site of a large lake in northwestern Germany. Researchers led by Jordi Serangeli of the University of Tübingen have also recovered 30 small flint flakes and two bone tools at the site, which suggest that a human relative such as Homo heidelbergensis scavenged the carcass. The bone tools may have been used to sharpen stone tools, since micro flakes were found embedded in them, explained team archaeologist Bárbara Rodríguez Álvarez. Archaeozoologist Ivo Verheijen said that the animal was a female with worn teeth. Old and sick elephants often remain near water, he added. The remains included straight tusks measuring about seven and one-half feet long, a complete lower jaw, vertebrae and ribs, and the large bones from three of its four legs. Verheijen said the elephant probably stood about ten and one-half feet tall at the shoulder, which is larger than today’s female elephants. Previous research has shown that as many as 20 different kinds of large animals once lived at the lake, making it an attractive hunting spot. Ten wooden spears dated to about 300,000 years ago have also been found nearby. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8656-200427-egypt-coffin-mummy,Egyptian,"3,600-Year-Old Mummy Discovered in Egypt. LUXOR, EGYPT— Ahram Online reports that a wood coffin containing a mummy, a small coffin made of mud, and funerary equipment dating to the 17th Dynasty (ca. 1635–1550 B.C.) were found in a mudbrick chapel in the Dra Abul Naga necropolis, which is located on Luxor’s West Bank. José Galán, a member of a joint Spanish and Egyptian archaeological mission, said the anthropoid coffin was carved from a single sycamore tree, coated with whitewash, and painted red. The poorly preserved mummy of a girl, aged approximately 15 years old at the time of death, was found resting on her side inside the coffin. She was wearing two spiral-shaped earrings coated with metal in one ear, and two rings, one made of bone and the other of metal, string, and a blue glass bead. A total of four necklaces fastened together with a faience clip rested on her chest. One of the necklaces was made of amethyst, carnelian, amber, blue glass, and quartz beads. The small mud coffin contained a wooden ushabti figurine wrapped in four linen bandages. In a nearby funerary shaft, Galán and his team also recovered a pair of leather sandals that had been dyed red and decorated with images of the god Bes, the goddess Taweret, a pair of cats, an ibex, and a rosette. Based upon their size, the sandals are thought to have been worn by a woman, he added. "

LONDON, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that ten stone tablets etched with straight and curved lines have been discovered among hearths, pits, tools, and flints at the archaeological site of Les Varines on the southeastern side of the Channel Island of Jersey. Known as plaquettes, the stones are thought to have been engraved between 23,000 and 14,000 years ago by Magdalenians—hunter-gatherers who migrated out of Spain, Portugal, and southern France during the last Ice Age. “Many of the lines, including the curved, concentric designs, appear to have been made through layered or repeated incisions,” said Silvia Bello of the Natural History Museum. Some of the lines may be abstract representations of horses, mammoths, and a human face, she added, although the images are simpler than those on plaquettes recovered from other Magdalenian sites. Chantal Conneller of Newcastle University said that the people at Les Varines may have been pioneer colonizers of the region. "

Archaeologist Miroslav Klasnakov said Late Bronze Age ingots unearthed inland are shaped like a stretched-out ox skin. These ingots, however, are similar to those recovered from ancient shipwrecks along southern Anatolia’s Mediterranean coastline. The shape of the copper ingots indicates that ancient Thracians had maritime trade contacts with peoples living near Turkey’s southern coast, Klasnakov explained. The ingots could also offer researchers information about mining and metallurgy in the Strandzha Mountains, he added. "

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a BBC News report, a team of researchers led by Mark Roberts of University College London analyzed artifacts recovered from a nearly 500,000-year-old intact site on the edge of a marsh at what is now the Boxgrove quarry in southern England. The presence of a Homo heidelbergensis shin bone suggests that a group of the possible human ancestors had gathered at the site to butcher a horse carcass. More than 2,000 flintknapping scatters, found in eight separate areas of the site, were reassembled by the researchers, who found that each pile had been left behind during the shaping of a biface knife. These implements were then probably used to butcher the horse. The animal’s flesh was removed, and its bones were smashed to remove marrow and grease, creating enough food to feed as many as 40 people. Marks on some of the horse bones indicate that they were used as retouchers to continue to shape the flint knives. The flint knives themselves have not been recovered, suggesting that they were carried away after the feast. "

José Alfredo Arellanes of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History said a total of 87 glyphs have been found to date. The images include two etched stone panels and smaller carved stones. One of the panels depicts a human figure with horns and claws clothed in a loincloth. Other images show an iguana, an eagle, and a female figure resembling a bat that may depict a deity. Arellanes said the Zapotec are thought to have made the carvings about 1,500 years ago. There were probably pyramids, a ball court, and a ceremonial area on the mountaintop, he added. "

According to Greek mythology, Atlas, a Titan, was forced to carry the sky on his shoulders after he was defeated by the Olympian Zeus. As many as 40 such statues of Atlas may have stood at the temple, which is thought to have been unfinished when the city was destroyed by the Carthaginians in 406 B.C. “The idea is to reposition one of these Atlases in front of the temple, so that it may serve as a guardian of the structure dedicated to the father of the gods,” said park director Roberto Sciarratta.

Ranjith of the Tamil Nadu Department of Archaeology and his colleagues have discovered a total of 250 cairn circles in southern India’s trade and industrial center of Kodumanal, which was inhabited from the fifth through the first centuries B.C. Inside most of the megalithic circles, Ranjith said the excavations have revealed chambered burial cists and three or four pots and bowls. Ten pots and bowls, however, were recently unearthed in a circle made of boulders and rectangular-shaped cists made of stone slabs. Each of these cists measures about 20 feet long and six and one-half feet wide. The grave could have belonged to a village head or the head of the community, Ranjith explained, because the size of the boulders, each facing east and west, are bigger than the boulders found in the other circles. The pots and bowls, once filled with grain, may have been placed outside the chambers for use in the afterlife, he added. Ranjith said the excavation team members have also recovered an animal skull that may have belonged to a wolf or a dog; beads; gold pieces; needles; copper; a workshop with mud walls; grooved tiles in a trench; pieces of beryl, carnelian, quartz, and jasper; and texts written in Tamil Brahmi.

ANCHORAGE, ALASKA—According to an Anchorage Daily News report, archaeologist Jeff Rasic of the National Park Service has investigated archaeological sites at Howard’s Pass, a several mile–wide tundra plateau located in the mountains of northern Alaska’s Brooks Range. The sites date back some 11,000 years, and include traces of houses, tent rings, food-storage pits, tool-making debris, and cairns that may have been used to help drive caribou into hunting traps. Wind-chill temperature in the pass can drop to about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit—so cold that caribou can freeze to death. Yet some of the sites appeared to have been occupied during the winter, Rasic said. Half of the dwellings’ living area was set underground, with cold-trap tunnels at the entrances, he explained. Rasic thinks Inupiaq peoples may have chosen to live there to harvest caribou and fish, and explained that the Inupiaq name for Howard’s Pass is Akutuq , a word also used for a food product made of whipped animal fat, sugar, and berries, which resembles wind-driven snow. “If you are someone trying to escape clouds of mosquitoes, winds aren’t necessarily bad. And maybe a windswept place is good for winter travel—hard and crusty, good to get around on,” he added. "

HAYAMA, JAPAN—Ryuho Kataoka of Japan’s Graduate University for Advanced Studies and National Institute of Polar Research and his colleagues investigated the possible source of an astronomical phenomenon described by witnesses in A.D. 620 as a fan of red pheasant feathers that stretched across the sky, according to a statement released by Japan's Research Organization of Information and Systems . In Japanese folklore, Kataoka said, pheasants were considered messengers from heaven. It had been previously suggested that the witnesses observed a red aurora produced during a magnetic storm, but Kataoka said that auroras observed today are not fan-shaped like pheasant tails. Auroras, he explained, are ribbon like, and wave across the sky. Comets rarely appear to be red, he added. When Kataoka adjusted for the magnetic latitude of Japan in A.D. 620, however, he and his team members found that an aurora may have appeared to have a pheasant-tail shape, especially during a strong magnetic storm. “This means that the A.D. 620 phenomenon was likely an aurora,” he said.

NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND— Gizmodo reports that archaeologists John Blong and Lisa-Marie Shillito of Newcastle University and their colleagues tested 21 coprolites unearthed in Oregon’s Paisley Caves for the presence of human sterols and bile, which are not soluble in water and thus chemically stable. Previous mitochondrial DNA testing of the ancient waste indicated that all of the samples were human in origin, but critics argued that DNA from later occupation of the cave may have washed into lower, older cave sediments and contaminated the samples. “We address issues of potential DNA contamination through fecal lipid biomarker analysis, providing evidence that there likely was DNA moving from younger human occupations into older cave sediments and coprolites, but also confirming that people were camping at the caves as early as 14,200 years ago,” Blong said. In the new analysis, only 13 of the 21 samples were identified as human droppings, while one was linked to a panther and another to a lynx. The researchers are now analyzing the coprolites for clues to what those early campers had eaten. "

GALVESTON, TEXAS—According to a statement released by Texas A&M University at Galveston , a human bone belonging to a member of the indigenous Lucayan people, the first group Christopher Columbus encountered in the Americas, has been discovered in a sediment core taken from Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas. Environmental scientist Pete van Hengstum, maritime archaeologist Richard Sullivan, and their colleagues radiocarbon dated the tibia fragment—only the second example of Lucayan remains found on the island—and associated organic material from the core, determining that the individual lived on the island between A.D. 1290 and 1295. This precise dating provides direct evidence that the Lucayans had migrated to the island by the thirteenth century. Sullivan said that stable isotope analysis of the bone indicated that the individual's diet included fish, berries, fruits, and roots. By the mid-1520s, the Europeans had wiped out the Lucayan population in the Bahamas through disease and enslavement. "

Fiona Marshall of Washington University in St. Louis said donkeys were not usually buried in such high-status graves, even in northwest China’s Tang Dynasty capital of Xi’an, which was located at one end of the trade route known as the Silk Road. The donkey bones found in Cui Shi’s tomb, however, were too small to represent useful pack animals, and they also showed wear similar to that found on animals who run and make frequent turns, Marshall added. Ancient texts indicate that Cui Shi was married to a skilled polo player who won the favor of Emperor Xizong. Cui may have also played the popular, fast-paced game, which was usually played on horseback, while riding a slower, safer donkey, Marshall explained. "

TAMPA, FLORIDA—Further investigation of the site of a lost cemetery in western Florida has confirmed the presence of 49 graves without disturbing the remains, according to a Tampa Bay 10 report. Founded in 1901, Zion Cemetery was part of an African American settlement known as Robles Pond. It is thought to have held about 800 graves when the cemetery fell out of use in the 1920s and the land began to be developed. White-only housing construction in the 1950s turned up three burials, but newspaper accounts at the time said the cemetery had been relocated in 1925. Rebecca O’Sullivan of the University of South Florida said researchers from Cardno and the Florida Public Archaeology Network have recovered shells, decorative glassware, and other items at the cemetery site. “The shells especially, there are connections that go back to traditions in West Africa, of shells being associated with water and death and the kind of afterlife, and that by leaving these shells in the grave, the deceased is able to pass over the water and go back home…in the afterlife,” she explained. A memorial is being planned for the site. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/9158-201022-kenya-sediment-core,Pre-Human,"East Africa Sediment Core Offers Human Evolution Clues. WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to a Science News report, a 450-foot-long sediment core from Kenya’s Koora Basin holds one million years of environmental data that could elucidate details of human evolution. Paleoanthropologist Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution said that chemical and microscopic studies of the layers in the sediment core revealed that some 400,000 years ago, volcanic eruptions reduced the size of lakes and the amount of available water, while the climate fluctuated dramatically. As large animals died out, they were replaced by smaller ones with more diverse diets, he explained. Between 500,000 and 320,000 years ago, hominins living at Kenya’s Olorgesailie site, which is located about 15 miles away from the core-drilling site, shifted from making cutting tools of local stone to the smaller, more carefully made objects made from imported materials that are characteristic of the Mesolithic. Potts and his colleagues suggest this shift in technology and the possible beginning of trade between hominin groups may have been prompted by fluctuating food and water shortages. “A cascade of ancient ecological changes led to alternating periods of resource abundance and scarcity, likely helping to make us the most adaptable [hominin] species that ever existed,” he explained.

GÖTTINGEN, GERMANY— The Guardian reports that an international team of researchers has uncovered evidence that Neanderthals systematically collected and processed seafood between 86,000 and 106,000 years ago at Figueira Brava, a cave on the coast of Portugal. The massive cave deposit includes remains of mussels, limpets, crabs, sharks, fish, eels, seals, dolphins, and marine birds. João Zilhão of the University of Barcelona explained that the fatty acids found in marine foods are thought to promote the growth of brain tissue. It had been previously thought that the cognitive abilities of modern humans alone benefited from the consumption of these nutrients. But the discovery of a massive deposit of marine foods at a Neanderthal site offers additional evidence that Neanderthals and modern humans were very similar to each other. The cave also contained stone tools, traces of roasted plants, and the bones of horses and deer. Some 100,000 years ago, Zilhão added, the cave was set back about one mile from the coastline, indicating that Neanderthals must have made baskets or bags in order to carry large quantities of shellfish to the shelter. The researchers suspect that the location of this deposit was key to its preservation. "

The dogs are thought to have inhabited the caves with humans, pushing back dog domestication in the region by about 4,000 years. Remains of wolves, which were bigger than the dogs and had distinct molars for tearing meat apart, were also found in the caves. “The remains found at Apulia represent to date the oldest specimens discovered in the Mediterranean area and could also represent the until-now missing evidence of the evolutionary process that led to the dog, the very first domesticated animal,” said Francesco Boschin of the University of Siena. Genetic analysis of the remains indicates that one of these dogs was related to a dog who lived about 14,000 years ago whose remains were unearthed in Germany. The animals may represent a cultural link between the two groups of people, Boschin added. He suggests that people and dogs migrated to southern Europe in search of warmer temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum. "

Avocational diver Gary Lefebvre spotted the first paddlewheel near Lake Champlain’s Colchester Shoal while exploring with a remotely operated vehicle. He alerted researchers at the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, who said the location of the wreckage, the style of the construction, and the charred condition of its timbers suggest the paddlewheel came from the Phoenix . A second look in the area with the remotely operated vehicle found a second, charred paddlewheel. Chris Sabick, director of research and archaeology at the museum, said that on the night of September 4, 1819, the paddlewheels located on either side of the Steamboat Phoenix tore loose from the vessel as its center burned and fleeing passengers boarded lifeboats and jumped into the water to escape. The hull continued to burn to the waterline as it drifted south and came to rest on Colchester Shoal reef, he added.

The remains of one of the cairns set in the hillside measures about 62 feet long and 40 feet wide. “We only found this one because we noticed that the nearby wall wasn’t straight, and was built around something that was no longer there,” said group member Ian Fewings. A geophysical survey, a 3-D drone survey, and a lidar image of the area revealed the oval-shaped structure. Excavation uncovered remnants of the cairn, in addition to Neolithic flints. “The cairn we have here is around 4,500 years old and would likely have been used as a burial site for one of the leaders or chieftains of this particular group of people,” Fewings said. The structures would have appeared bright white in color, he added. A group of Neolithic huts was found on an adjacent hillside in 2015, although Fewings explained that the cairns are thought to be slightly older than the settlement. Over time, the stones in the cairns would have weathered and faded in color, and were probably reused by farmers to build walls and other structures, he added. "

The study suggests that people ate mostly terrestrial plants and animals, despite living close to marine resources. Rodents such as those from the guinea pig family, the agouti, and the paca; the brocket deer; and catfish are all thought to have been consumed, in addition to wild and cultivated plants such as cassava, corn, and squash. Research team member André Colonese of the University of York said that populations living in lowland Amazonia must have dedicated considerable time and effort to hunting, forest management, and plant cultivation.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/9030-200916-linear-a-fractions,Bronze Age,"Researchers Untangle Crete’s Ancient Number System. BOLOGNA, ITALY—According to a statement released by Elsevier , Silvia Ferrara of the University of Bologna and her colleagues conducted a new study of the 3,500-year-old Minoan system of fractions in the syllabic sign and numerical notation system known as Linear A. Previous attempts to understand the system of fractions were complicated by damaged documents and the contradictory use of certain signs—perhaps because the system changed over time. The researchers therefore limited the study to documents dated to between 1600 and 1450 B.C. They then combined the study of the fraction sign shapes and their use in inscriptions with statistical, computational, and typological strategies to assign them mathematical values. After excluding impossible outcomes, the computation yielded nearly four million possible solutions. Typological data were then used to compare the results with fractions commonly found in use in history. Statistical tests also helped to trim the list of possibilities. Ferrara and her team concluded that Linear A’s lowest fraction was 1/60. The study also suggests that the Linear B script used by Mycenaean Greek culture between 1450 and 1200 B.C. reused some of these fractions as units of measurement. "

ABYDOS, EGYPT—According to an Ahram Online report, a team of researchers led by Sameh Iskander of New York University uncovered foundation deposits, ten large storerooms, and niches cut into the walls of the southwest corner of the Temple of Ramesses II in Abydos. Mostafa Waziri of the Supreme Council of Antiquities said that the foundation deposits, which include plaques inscribed with Ramesses II’s throne name, copper tool models, pottery, grindstones, and food offerings, were buried in 1279 B.C. when construction of the temple began. It had been previously thought that the temple was built by Seti I, the father of Ramesses II. “This discovery has changed the physical appearance of the Abydos landscape and shed considerable light on our understanding of the temple and its economy during the thirteenth century B.C.,” Iskander explained. The storerooms at the site held grain and other temple provisions, offerings, and equipment, and were roofed with vaulted brick ceilings. In the niches, the researchers found the heads and bones of 12 sacrificial bulls dated to the Ptolemaic period. “This is a testimony to the vivid memory of Ramesses II in the Egyptian mind 1,000 years after his reign,” Iskander said. A complete bull skeleton was also found buried under the temple floor. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8688-200511-pre-columbian-andes,Pre-Columbian,"Ancient Genomes from Central Andes Analyzed. CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a Science Magazine report, a new genetic study of ancient human remains unearthed in the highlands and coastal regions of Peru’s Central Andes Mountains indicates that some 9,000 years ago, groups that lived in the highlands were genetically distinct from those that lived along the Pacific coast, and that by 5,800 years ago, the population that lived in the north was genetically distinct from the population in the south. Population geneticists David Reich and Nathan Nakatsuka of Harvard University, paleogenomicist Lars Fehren-Schmitz of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and their colleagues note that genes flowed between these groups in the Andes, and with populations living outside the Andes, but the exchanged slowed about 2,000 years ago. These regional genetic differences persist today, they added. This genetic continuity suggests that the fall of Andean cultures such as the Moche, Wari, and Nazca was not the result of massive immigration, and that local people did not die out when they were invaded. In contrast, they added, people living in the cosmopolitan urban centers of the Tiwanaku and Inca cultures came from varied genetic backgrounds. "

The girl’s poorly preserved remains were found next to a platform on which a large jar and part of a horse’s spinal cord were found. Last month, the excavation team unearthed the remains of a woman in a nearby tomb dated to the same period. She had also been buried next to a platform supporting a blue jug. Jafari-Zand suggests that both of the tombs were damaged in antiquity. “Tepe Ashraf is the second place after the Tepe Sialk (in Isfahan province) that has yielded the discovery of such jar tombs that offers valuable clues to uncover the obscure history of pre-Islamic Isfahan,” he explained.

GÖTTINGEN, GERMANY— Science Magazine reports that researchers led by Raphael Hermann of the University of Göttingen created bronze swords and staged battles with them in order to determine if Bronze Age warriors actually fought with weapons made of the soft alloy, or reserved them for ceremonial purposes. Hermann and his team members planned a series of blade-on-blade blows, and strikes on shields and spears, and recorded marks left on the new bronze swords. They then asked members of a medieval dueling club to use the new weapons in ways described in medieval combat manuals. The researchers noted the wear patterns on the swords after the mock battles, and compared them to microscopic marks on actual Bronze Age weapons dated from 1600 to 600 B.C. As a result, the researchers were able to assign wear patterns to specific sword moves and combinations. Not only did the wear marks on the ancient weapons suggest Bronze Age warriors used them to fight, the researchers noted that fighting styles developed as well-practiced techniques that spread across Europe over time. “In order to fight the way the marks show, there has to be a lot of training involved,” Hermann explained.

MEXICO CITY, MEXICO—According to an Associated Press report, researchers led by Helena Barba Meinecke of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History have identified the wreckage of a paddle-wheel steamboat discovered in 2017 as La Unin , a vessel that carried Maya people to Cuba to work in sugarcane fields before it sank near the Yucatan port of Sisal in 1861. Although slavery was illegal in Mexico, the operators of La Unin and similar vessels are thought to have purchased Mayas who were captured as combatants or left landless during the rebellion known as the War of the Castes, which took place from 1847 to 1901. “The grandparents and great-grandparents of the inhabitants of Sisal told them about a steam ship that took away Mayas during the War of the Castes,” Barba Meinecke said. “And one of the people in Sisal who saw how they led the Mayas away as slaves, told his son and then he told his grandson, and it was that person who led us to the general area of the shipwreck.” It is unclear from ship records if La Unin was carrying any Mayas as cargo on its last voyage. The researchers plan to look for descendants of transported Mayas in Havana, in a neighborhood known as “Campeche,” Barba Meinecke added. "

HAIFA, ISRAEL—Exploration of a 1,300-year-old shipwreck just off the coast of Israel is offering new insights into life in the region at a time of transition from Byzantine to Islamic rule, according to a report from The Jerusalem Post . Researchers from the University of Haifa’s Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies began excavating the wreck in 2016. They have found that its cargo included more than 100 amphoras filled with products including olives, dates, figs, fish, pine nuts, grapes, and raisins. The researchers believe the ship made stops in Cyprus, Egypt, and possibly at a port along the coast of Israel before it sank. The size and richness of its cargo appear to contradict the generally accepted belief that commerce in the eastern Mediterranean was limited during the transition from Byzantine to Islamic rule in the seventh to eighth century A.D. The excavations have also turned up several Christian crosses and the name of Allah written in Arabic. “We do not know whether the crew was Christian or Muslim, but we found traces of both religions,” said University of Haifa archaeologist Deborah Cvikel. Given that the wreck occurred close to shore and that no human bones have been found, the researchers believe everyone on board survived the ship’s sinking. "

In fact, the eroded, Iberian-style images found in Mount Ertxiña’s Danbolinzulo Cave date to between 40,000 and 20,000 years ago, during a period when it had been previously thought that very little artwork had been created in what is now the Basque Country. Blanca Ochoa of the Universidad del Pais Vasco and her colleagues Marcos García-Diez and Irene Vigiola-Toña said the differences between the two styles of artwork are surprising because the groups lived in close proximity to each other and are likely to have come in contact as they roamed in search of food. “We think maybe that they have different cultural backgrounds,” Ochoa said. “But we don’t know why they chose to have two very distinct styles.” Between 20,000 and 13,000 years ago, she added, the differences in styles disappeared.

The researchers determined that about 80 percent of the beads in the study had been made from shells that did not originate in the Lesotho highlands. Stewart said the ornaments had come from at least 200 miles away, and may have been crafted by hunter-gatherers living some 620 miles away. Modern hunter-gatherers, he added, use such beads to begin and maintain relationships with other groups. Ancient beads may have served a similar purpose, he explained. The beads may have been exchanged along with information about resources, the condition of the landscape, other groups of people or potential marriage partners, animals, and plants. "

Bettina Tremmel of the Westphalie Department for the Preservation and Care of Field Monuments in Germany said the find is rare because Roman soldiers were not usually buried with their military equipment. This weapon is thought to have belonged to a legionary infantryman, an auxiliary infantryman, or a centurion. Tremmel said the dagger has an iron blade with deep grooves and a long, tapering point. Its handle is inlaid with silver and decorated with rivets. The sheath, also made of iron, was lined with linden wood and decorated with red glass; silver; black trim made of sulphur, copper, silver, and lead; and red enamel. Rings on the sheath allowed it to be hung from a belt. Traces of a decorated leather belt were also found in the grave. “The dagger was a formidable weapon to have as a backup should the sword be lost or damaged,” Tremmel explained. “The penalties for loss of equipment were so severe, there was every incentive for a soldier to keep a tight grip on his helmet, sword, and dagger.” "

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS—According to a statement released by UChicago Medicine , a new study suggests that Sardinians experienced less genetic turnover than populations living in mainland Europe, where large-scale migration is thought to have occurred during the Bronze Age. An international team of scientists analyzed the genomes of 70 Sardinians whose remains were recovered from more than 20 archaeological sites spanning a period of about 6,000 years. The scientists then compared the Sardinian DNA to DNA collected from other ancient and modern peoples. The researchers determined that Neolithic Sardinians were closely related to their contemporaries in mainland Europe. Sardinian genetic ancestry remained stable through 900 B.C., at a time when populations in mainland Europe began to shift and mix as people from other regions moved across the continent. It had been previously thought that a new style of stone tower that appeared on Sardinia around 900 B.C. may have been constructed by Bronze Age arrivals. The study of Sardinian genomes did detect population movement on the island in later periods, however, such as the arrival of the Phoenicians from what is now Lebanon, and the Punics, from what is now Tunisia, as early as 500 B.C. During the Roman and medieval periods, the scientists also found evidence of migration to the island from Italy and Spain. "

Researchers had suggested the eruption triggered a “volcanic winter” that cooled Earth’s surface for a period of 1,000 years, resulting in the near-extinction of hominins. In this scenario, members of a small populuation of modern human survivors in Africa were thought to have migrated along the coast of the Indian Ocean and repopulated Asia some 60,000 years ago. But, according to J.N. Pal of the University of Allahabad, stone artifacts unearthed in northern India’s Middle Son River Valley indicate the region has been continuously inhabited for the past 80,000 years. The artifacts are similar to tools found in Arabia that date to between 100,000 and 47,000 years ago, and 65,000-year-old tools uncovered in Australia. The tools could therefore be linked to the dispersal of early modern humans out of Africa, added Chris Clarkson of the University of Queensland. The researchers explained that the evidence for thriving modern human populations at the time of the eruption also supports fossil and genetic evidence for the modern human migration out of Africa and intermixing with other species of hominins more than 60,000 years ago.

MIAMI, FLORIDA—According to a statement released by the University of Miami , archaeologist Traci Ardren conducted a lidar survey of the ancient 60-mile road that connects the Maya cities of Cobá and Yaxuná on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. Known as a sacbe , or sacred road, the highway was engineered to be a flat surface made of stone and covered in white plaster that may have glowed at night. Analysis of the data found more than 8,000 structures along the route, and determined that the road does not follow a straight line, as had been previously thought. Ardren said the survey also detected towns and cities that predate the road along its route. She and her colleagues suggest the road was built by Lady K’awiil Ajaw, the ruler of Cobá at the turn of the seventh century A.D., to connect Cobá and Yaxuná and the settlements situated along the way. Lady K’awiil Ajaw may have even built the road in an effort to expand her power and invade Yaxuná. Ardren said her team plans to examine household goods in the two cities to see if they are similar to each other. "

İZMİR, TURKEY— Hurriyet Daily News reports that some additional pieces of a game set first unearthed in 2012 at Başur Mound in southeastern Turkey have been recovered by a team of researchers led by Haluk Sağlamtimur of Ege University. The game is thought to have been an ancestor of chess that was played in a cemetery at the site some 5,000 years ago. “This is probably a grave gift,” Sağlamtimur said. “This game set does not seem to be played too much; there is no wear on it.” Similar figurative game pieces have been found in Egypt, he added. The game board, which would have provided clues as to how the game was played, has not been found and probably disintegrated. “When we consider the shapes and numbers of the stones, we estimate that the game is based on number four,” Sağlamtimur explained.

JENA, GERMANY—According to a report in Science Magazine , population geneticists Felix Key and Johannes Krause and bacterial genomicist Alexander Herbig of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History developed a technique to detect DNA from disease-causing bacteria in ancient remains. The researchers were able to reconstruct eight Salmonella enterica genomes after screening samples taken from the teeth of more than 2,500 people who had been buried in Europe, Russia, or Turkey more than 6,500 years ago. Two of the genomes, found in the remains of hunter-gatherers who lived in what is now Russia, are from strains of the pathogen that cause miscarriages in horses and sheep. The other six genomes, recovered from ancient farmers and pastoralists, include the progenitor of a rare strain of bacteria that can now be deadly to humans, but in the past would have caused a milder form of illness in both humans and animals. The analysis also suggests that early farmers picked up Salmonella enterica from an unknown animal host, rather than from domesticated pigs some 4,000 years ago, as had been previously thought. "

Piacentini said the wooden lid was very fragile and full of sand, so her team members decided to detach the stucco cover from the wood in order to save the artwork. “It was a very delicate operation that had us holding our breath, we had tears in our eyes,” she said. Conservators Ilaria Perticucci and Rita Reale will restore the leopard painting in laboratories at Aswan. Piacentini’s team opened the tomb last year and found some 30 bodies that had been buried in the second century B.C.

Garfinkel said the Bronze Age temple is similar to Canaanite temples unearthed in northern Israel. The front of the square-shaped temple compound features two columns and two towers leading to a large hall, he explained. The inner area has four supporting columns and several uncarved standing stones. The temple also has several side rooms, he added. Artifacts uncovered at the site include bronze cauldrons, jewelry, daggers, ax heads, scarabs, and a gold-plated bottle inscribed with the name of the Egyptian pharaoh, Ramses II.

ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND—According to a statement released by the University of Aberdeen , researchers led by archaeologist Gordon Noble of the University of Aberdeen and Mark Hall of Perth Museum have created 3-D images of the Tulloch Stone, a six-foot-tall Pictish monolith discovered during road construction in 2017. The photographs reveal that the male figure carved into the stone is wearing a helmet and necklace. A line around his left ankle could indicate footwear or leggings. He is also shown carrying a distinctive type of spear known to have been used between the third and sixth centuries. Noble said the details of this image, when compared to similar carvings found on other Pictish stones, suggest that the images represent a generic sacred image of a warrior, rather than specific individuals. Hall suggests that such images, when placed at strategic locations or in elite cemeteries, may have conveyed warrior ideology. A war-oriented society may have been better able to resist the rule of the Roman Empire, Noble added. "

Florin, Fairbairn, and Clarkson analyzed charred plant remains recovered from cooking hearths at Madjedbebe, a sandstone rock shelter in northeastern Australia’s Arnhem Land inhabited as early as 65,000 years ago. The plant remains included fruit pips, nut shells, tuber peelings, and fragments of palm stem thought to have been discarded from cooked meals. Florin, Fairbairn, and Clarkson then partnered with Nango and Djandjomerr to identify the modern versions of these plants, such as canarium, pandanus nuts, and cheeky yam, and the multistage cooking techniques required to make them edible. The researchers note that adapting to this diet would have required the first Australians to develop new technologies, including axes with ground edges and grinding stones, which have also been uncovered at the Madjedbebe rock shelter.

Known as Shanidar Z, the remains include the upper torso, arms, and skull of an older adult, based upon the wear found on the teeth. Barker suggests the body was intentionally buried with its left hand under its head in a water channel in the cave floor that had been dug out to make it deeper. Shanidar Z’s lower body is thought to have been removed from the cave during excavations in the 1960s, when the partial remains of approximately ten Neanderthal men, women, and children were discovered, along with pollen, which suggested flowers had been placed in the burials. Many of these specimens are thought to have been lost during the Iraq War. Pomeroy said a rock found near Shanidar Z’s head may have been placed there as a grave marker. The new discovery will allow researchers to explore Neanderthal death rituals with modern technology, she added. "

TROMSØ, NORWAY— Science Magazine reports that archaeologist Hans Peter Blankholm of the Arctic University of Norway and his colleagues found “unhealthy” levels of toxic metals in the bones of Atlantic cod and harp seals recovered from garbage pits at eight archaeological sites on Norway’s Varanger Peninsula. The sites range in age from 3,800 to 6,300 years old. The analysis revealed that the cod and seal bones both contained high levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury, which can cause organ damage in humans when consumed. The metals are thought to have leached into the water supply as sea levels rose and covered previously dry land. Blankholm and his colleagues said, however, that it is unclear if eating contaminated sea creatures harmed the people who lived in these prehistoric Arctic communities, since they also ate fruit and meat from reindeer and rabbits, and may not have lived long enough to accumulate many pollutants from the otherwise beneficial, high-protein foods from the sea. The next phase of research will analyze human remains recovered from the archaeological sites. "

VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA— Science Magazine reports that geologist Erin Matchan of the University of Melbourne and her colleagues have dated volcanic rocks at southeastern Australia’s Budj Bim Volcanic Complex and the Tower Hill volcano, which is located about 25 miles away, to about 37,000 years ago. In the 1940s, archaeologists discovered a stone ax underneath the volcanic rocks at the Tower Hill volcano, indicating that people lived in the region before the eruptions occurred. Matchan explained that the structure of the volcanoes suggests they grew their peaks within a period spanning just days to months. The researchers think an ancient story told by the Aboriginal Gunditjmara people about four giant beings, one of whom transformed into the Budj Bim volcano, might reference this volcanic activity and could reflect an oral tradition that has lasted for tens of thousands of years. Previous analysis of hair samples indicate that many Australian populations have occupied the same regions for nearly 50,000 years. “As with all First Nations around the world, our stories, heritage, identity and survival are connected to our traditional homelands and waters,” said Damein Bell of Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation.

The first temple on the site has been tentatively dated to the tenth century B.C., while the monumental temple complex built on top of it has been dated to the late tenth century to early ninth century B.C. Kisilevitz said the temple complex at Motza conformed to religious conventions in the Kingdom of Judah at the time, but according to biblical texts, King Hezekiah and King Josiah restricted worship to the structure known as Jerusalem’s First Temple. The presence of the temple complex in Motza, she added, therefore suggests that other temples continued to operate outside of Jerusalem. Motza’s local leaders may have built the temple complex to increase their control over the region and bolster the success of the growing grain distribution business, she explained. Cultic artifacts including human-shaped and horse figurines, a cult stand decorated with lions or sphinxes, a stone altar, a stone offering table, and a pit filled with ash and bones have been uncovered at the site.

MAASTRICHT, THE NETHERLANDS— Science Magazine reports that a senet game board in the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in San Jose, California, has yielded new information about the ancient game's evolution. Similar to backgammon, senet seems to have been played by two competitors, who each rolled dice to move their five pawns to the final square along a game board divided into three rows of 10 spaces. Although the game became popular among Egyptians some 5,000 years ago as a purely entertaining pastime, tomb art from about 700 years later shows deceased individuals playing senet against living relatives. By the early New Kingdom, symbols on the game board had changed. Egyptian texts mention that the game had taken on religious significance, reflecting a soul's journey to the afterlife through Duat, the realm of the dead. Maastricht University archaeologist Walter Crist said the Rosicrucian board, which he has tentatively dated to the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca. 1550–1295 B.C.), appears to be an early example of the redesigned game. One of its squares, which in earlier versions of the game was marked with an X, features the hieroglyph for water, believed by scholars to represent a body of water the soul encountered on its way through Duat. “It may be one of the first times that this aspect of the journey through the afterlife is visually rendered on the board,” said Crist.

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA— BBC News reports that researcher Damien Finch of the University of Melbourne used ancient mud wasps’ nests to date the so-called Gwion style of rock art found in northwestern Australia. Finch noted that, while encasing insect prey in mud, wasps often collect fragments of charcoal from the ground that can be radiocarbon dated. The wasps then affix the mud structures onto rock faces. Traces of this mud has been found under rock art, which provides its maximum possible age, while mud found on top of the rock art gives its minimum age, Finch explained. By collecting dates from artwork all over the region, he estimates the oldest images date back about 12,000 years, rather than 16,000 years ago, as previously thought. “All this is important because we can now begin to match the rock art with other types of information we are getting in the Kimberley, such as the stone tools that are uncovered by archaeologists and what we understand was happening with the climate and sea levels,” Finch said.

The remains are thought to have belonged to a woman who died at about 30 years of age. Her skull resembles other Paleoindian skulls found in the cave, and she also had cavities in her teeth. Stinnesbeck said other skulls unearthed in North America from this time period are usually longer and narrower than the skulls from the Tulum cave. In addition, their teeth are worn, without cavities, suggesting that their diet included hard foods. Stinnesbeck and his colleagues think the differences they observed in skull morphology could be evidence of more than one group of migrants to the Americas, or the result of the isolation of a small group on the Yucatán Peninsula.

Craig explained that the pots at each location had been manufactured in different ways between 16,000 and 12,000 years ago, and were likely invented independently by different groups. For example, pots recovered along the lower Amur likely held salmon and freshwater fish, while pots from the middle Amur held traces of fats from ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep, or goats. Craig and his team suggest that individual hunter-gatherer communities living in Northeast Asia, when faced with harsh Ice Age conditions, invented pottery so that they could cook their food and thus extract more nutrition from it, boosting their chances of survival.

Vassilis Lambrinoudakis of the University of Athens said the structure was demolished to make room for the Tholos, where patients are known from historical records to have slept in the basement in order to dream of Asclepius, who would reveal a cure for illness. The newly uncovered building also had a basement space, and probably also served a similar function, he added. “This means the worship of Asclepius appears to have begun earlier in the Asclepeion of Epidaurus. Until now, it was believed to have begun around 550 B.C.,” Lamprinoudakis said. The presence of the building also explains the orientation of some later construction at the site. "

PORT ANGELES, WASHINGTON—According to a Peninsula Daily News report, several human bones were spotted by hikers on the banks of an eroding beach trail about two miles from the site of a 2,700-year-old Klallam fishing village known as Tse-whit-zen. The village was discovered in 2003 during a bridge construction project. Forensic anthropologist Kathy Taylor estimated the bones recovered from the embankment are between 500 and 1,000 years old. “There’s a high probability [the remains] are Native American,” added Bill White, Lower Elwha Tribal archaeologist. Officials have covered the collapsing harbor embankment with fabric to try to prevent further damage. Any Native American remains recovered from the embankment during repair work will be repatriated to local tribal members. "

POZNAŃ, POLAND—According to a Science in Poland report, a two-inch piece of donkey bone thought to have been carved into an anthropomorphic figurine some 8,000 years ago has been unearthed by an international team led by M.Z. Barański at Çatalhöyük, the site of a large Neolithic settlement in southern Turkey that was inhabited for more than 1,000 years. “This is undoubtedly an important find with a very simplified, but clear depiction of human features in the form of eyes,” said Kamilla Pawłowska of Adam Mickiewicz University. She found the artifact while screening the contents of a bin recovered from a room at Çatalhöyük where food had been stored between 6500 and 6300 B.C. Pawłowska added that donkeys were a rare food source at Çatalhöyük, but butchered donkey bones have been recovered. Sheep and goats were more commonly used as meat sources, she explained. "

MINYA GOVERNORATE, EGYPT— Ahram Online reports that the communal tombs of senior officials and high priests of the god Djehuty—who was also known as Thoth, the god of knowledge, the moon, measurement, wisdom, and writing—have been discovered in Upper Egypt, in the necropolis of Khumun at the Tuna El-Gabal archaeological site. Mustafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the 16 tombs contained sarcophagi and wooden coffins. Five of the sarcophagi were carved from limestone in an anthropoid shape and engraved with hieroglyphic texts, he added. Five well-preserved wooden coffins were also discovered, along with more than 10,000 engraved ushabti figurines made of blue and green faience. Other artifacts from the tombs include more than 700 amulets, some made of pure gold; painted canopic jars carved from limestone; pottery; tools for cutting stone and moving sarcophagi; wooden hammers; and baskets made of palm fronds.

PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY—According to a report in Science News , a new study indicates that modern Africans inherited DNA from migrating Neanderthals. Geneticist Joshua Akey of Princeton University and his colleagues conducted a statistical analysis of DNA gathered from 2,504 modern Africans, Europeans, and East Asians, and compared it with records of DNA extracted from Neanderthal remains in Siberia and southeastern Europe. They concluded that modern Africans, on average, indirectly inherited as much as 0.5 percent of their genome from Neanderthals. The Neanderthal gene variants, which may have acted to strengthen the immune system and modify sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, are thought to have been carried to Africa by a human population that left the continent between 100,000 and 150,000 years ago, interbred with Neanderthals outside of Africa, and then returned. “Our work highlights how humans and Neanderthals interacted for hundreds of thousands of years, with populations dispersing out of and back into Africa,” Akey said. “Remnants of Neanderthal DNA survive in every modern human population studied to date.” "

COLUMBUS, OHIO—According to a Cosmos Magazine report, Mark Hubbe of The Ohio State University and his colleagues suggest that the peopling of North America may have been a more complex process than previously thought. The researchers analyzed four human skulls recovered from a now underwater limestone cave system in Quintana Roo, Mexico, which have been dated to between 9,000 and 13,000 years old. Hubbe said information collected with CT scans and X-rays revealed that the four skulls had diverse sets of characteristics. The researchers then compared the craniofacial features observed in the four skulls with those of ancient skulls uncovered in South America and others around the world. They concluded that the oldest of the four skulls resembled the skulls of North American Arctic populations, while the other three resembled modern Europeans, Asian and Native American groups, and Arctic populations with some features found in ancient skulls from South America, respectively. “We always assumed that what was happening in South America was true in North America,” Hubbe said. “Now we need to revise that.” "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8392-200130-peru-monolith-scan,Pre-Columbian,"2,000-Year-Old Monolith Engravings Recorded in Peru. LEYMEBAMBA, PERU— Live Science reports that a team led by archaeologist Daniel Fernandez-Davila and application engineer Jason Kleinhenz of Exact Metrology have created a 3-D scan of a one-ton monolith located in a remote jungle of northern Peru. The monolith was carved from a piece of sedimentary rock that measures about 2.5 feet tall and 10 feet wide. This type of stone is not found in the jungle valley, however, and is thought to have been transported to the site and engraved with abstract, ornate images some 2,000 years ago. “That itself was a tremendous effort, a communal effort definitely,” Fernandez-Davila said. Among the images are two fangs believed to be associated with a deity known to scholars as a “feline feathered figure,” which has been found at other 2,000-year-old archaeological sites in Peru. The researchers created the scan because they are concerned that the images on the stone could soon be lost to erosion. The presence of the monolith, Fernandez-Davila explained, suggests that the jungle valley where it is located was probably an important sacred space. He plans to return to the site for additional investigations. "

TORONTO, CANADA—According to a statement released by the University of Toronto , animal bones collected from northeastern Lebanon’s Nachcharini Cave in the 1970s have been radiocarbon dated to about 10,000 years ago—a period known as the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. Although excavations at the site ceased in 1975, at the outset of the Lebanese Civil War, reanalysis of the previously unearthed material by archaeologists Stephen Rhodes, Edward Banning, and Michael Chazan has shown that the cave was used as a hunting camp. Rhodes explained that sheep hunters who lived in settlements in the Jordan Valley used the camp on a short-term basis as they began to build mudbrick dwellings and cultivate crops in the Jordan Valley. Eventually, he speculated, the sheep hunters may have domesticated the wild sheep. "

Researchers from the National Museums Northern Ireland, the University of Manchester, Queen’s University Belfast, and Kingsbridge Private Hospital collected samples for DNA analysis from the mummified woman, who is known as Takabuti, and found that her mitochondrial DNA lineage is more similar to that usually found in European populations. A review of CT scans of her body identified an object in her body cavity, which had previously been thought to be her heart, as material that was used to pack a fatal knife wound in her back, near her left shoulder. Her heart, however, was also discovered in her body and found to be perfectly preserved. It was also revealed that Takabuti had 33 teeth, rather than the usual 32, and an extra vertebra. "

NOVOSIBIRSK, RUSSIA— Cosmos Magazine reports that Kseniya Kolobova of Siberia’s Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, Richard Roberts of the University of Wollongong, and their colleagues have discovered 74 Neanderthal bones, animal fossils, plant remains, and more than 3,000 stone blades in Siberia’s Chagyrskaya Cave. Kolobova said the blades resemble Micoquian blades produced by Neanderthals living some 1,800 miles away in what is now Eastern Europe. “Central and Eastern Europe is really the heartland of this Micoquian tradition,” Roberts explained. Kolobova and Roberts said the presence of Micoquian blades in Chagyrskaya Cave suggests that Neanderthals migrated to Siberia from Eastern Europe, but, they add, such tools have not been found in Siberia's Denisova Cave, where Neanderthal remains have also been recovered. Did more than one wave of Neanderthals migrate to Siberia? Genetic studies have indicated that the Neanderthals arrived in Siberia in at least two waves, since the later Neanderthal occupants of Denisova Cave were more closely related to European Neanderthals than they were to earlier Neanderthals who lived in the same cave. Roberts said Micoquian blades could also help researchers track Neanderthal migration. “It’s just yet another indication that Neanderthals were just as creative, just as industrious, just as explorative in their nature as modern humans were,” he explained.

The young man’s remains were found under a pile of volcanic ash, lying facedown on a wooden bed in a small room in the Collegium Augustalium, where an imperial cult worshiped the emperor Augustus. The man is thought to have been the caretaker of the building, and asleep at the time of the disaster. Petrone said analysis of the glassy black material, which was found only in the man’s skull, revealed proteins typically found in brain tissue, and fatty acids found in human hair, while analysis of charred wood at the site indicates the temperature had reached 968 degrees Fahrenheit. Petrone and his colleagues suggest the glassy material could be human brain tissue transformed by the heat of the eruption into glass. "

MEXICO CITY, MEXICO— BBC News reports that archaeologists from Mexico’s Directorate of Archaeological Rescue and National Institute of Anthropology and History uncovered a fourteenth-century temazcal , or ritual steam bath, measuring about 16 feet long by nine feet wide. The discovery of the temazcal, which had been marked on historic maps, has allowed the researchers to pinpoint the location of Temazcaltitlán, one of the oldest neighborhoods of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. This area of the city was known as a place where female deities such as Tlazolteotl, the goddess of childbirth and purification, and Coatlicue, Toci, Chalchiuhtlicue, and Mayahuel, who are linked to land, fertility, water, and the fermented beverage pulque, were venerated. A house thought to have been inhabited by Mexica nobility shortly after the Spanish conquest, and a tannery built in the eighteenth century, were also found on the site. "

In the Hindu tradition, makaras serve as guardians of gateways and thresholds, especially in throne rooms and temples, and work as transport for the river goddess Ganga and the sea god Varuna. Researchers who traveled to the site found an additional 13 pieces of the sandstone statue, which is thought to date to the sixth century. “We have not yet moved the body parts or excavated the head from the site and have told park rangers in the area to guard it in order for officials from relevant ministries and institutions to come and study in detail about the site’s history and reconstruct the pieces,” said department director Sun Kong. No temple foundations have been found in the area, leading the researchers to suggest the statue was carved in place from the local rock. "

GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN—Søren Faurby of the University of Gothenburg and his colleagues suggest that hominins started triggering the extinctions of other creatures about four million years ago, according to a BBC News report. Faurby and his team compared the rate of extinction for large and small carnivores with environmental changes and the changes in brain size of human ancestors in East Africa such as Australopithecus , thought to have evolved some 4.2 million years ago, and Ardipithecus , estimated to have lived some 4.4 million years ago. The researchers found that the extinction rate of large carnivores correlated with the increasing brain size of human ancestors and changes in vegetation, but not with changes in precipitation or temperature. Faurby and his team members think early human ancestors may have stolen prey brought down by large carnivores, thus depriving them of food. "

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8366-200120-teeth-hard-plants,Pre-Human,"What Did Human Ancestors Eat?. ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI—According to a statement released by Washington University in St. Louis , a study of the wear and tear caused by food particles on tooth enamel suggests human ancestors may have eaten more hard plant foods than previously thought. Biological anthropologist Adam van Casteren explained that early hominins such as Australopiths had very large teeth and jaws, and probably also had huge chewing muscles that would have allowed them to crush nuts, seeds, tubers, and woody plant material. Scientists predicted such a diet would leave microscopic pits on fossilized hominin teeth, but most known specimens do not show this kind of wear and tear. So, Van Casteren and his colleagues dragged tiny pieces of seed shells across a Bornean orangutan molar, and observed the wear and tear they caused. The researchers found that the seed fragments did not leave behind any pits, scratches, or fractures in the orangutan molar, even though the seed particles began to break down as if they had been chewed. Van Casteren and his colleagues suggest the study will help researchers figure out what our earliest ancestors actually ate. "

In 1533, Spanish conquistador Hernando Pizarro ordered that the revered idol at Pachacamac be destroyed, and so researchers did not know if the statue unearthed within the temple was the sacred object or another artifact. Sepúlveda and her colleagues radiocarbon dated the statue to sometime between A.D. 760 and 876, which suggests that it was made by the Wari people and that the oracle site was important hundreds of years before the rise of the Inca Empire. Analysis of the statue's surface with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry revealed traces of color, Sepúlveda added. Its teeth were once painted white, and parts of its headdress were decorated with yellow pigment. Cinnabar, a red pigment that is found in the Andes Mountains some 250 miles away, was also detected. The red color may have been a symbol of economic might and political power, Sepúlveda explained. "

BOULDER, COLORADO—According to a report in The Guardian , a new study of shell tools recovered in 1949 from a coastal cave in central Italy suggests that some of them were made from shells retrieved directly from the seabed, and not collected on the shore. Animal teeth found alongside the tools were dated to between 90,000 and 100,000 years ago, when Neanderthals are thought to have been the only hominins living in Western Europe. The tools, which are thought to have been used as scrapers, were made from the shell of a clam known as Callista chione, which lives in coastal waters at least three feet deep. Paola Villa of the University of Colorado Boulder said microscopic evaluation revealed that almost a quarter of the shell tools did not show signs of the wear and tear usually seen on shells collected on the seashore after being tossed in the waves. Rather, these shells were smooth, as if they had been harvested while still holding a live clam. It is not clear if the clams were eaten, however. Villa and her colleagues also found lumps of volcanic rock in the collection that may have been collected from the beach. Such pieces of pumice are known to have been used by early modern humans to polish pieces of bone. "

KIEL, GERMANY—According to a statement released by Kiel University , a Slovak-German research team has developed a technique to study Neolithic settlements based upon the alignment of buildings over time. Archaeologist Nils Müller-Scheeßel of Kiel's Collaborative Research Centre explained that researchers have long thought that Neolithic structures were used for about a generation before they were rebuilt. Perception psychologists, he added, have found that healthy people usually favor their left visual field over their right, and thus will regularly deviate slightly to the left of center—a phenomenon known as “pseudo-neglect.” Employing this concept, Müller-Scheeßel and his colleagues conducted geophysical surveys of Neolithic village sites in southwestern Slovakia. They detected a slight counterclockwise shift as new buildings were constructed over older ones. The researchers then compared this data with radiocarbon dates. The study suggests that the concept of pseudo-neglect could allow researchers to create a relative sequence for Neolithic housing sites without extensive excavation, Müller-Scheeßel explained, although traditional dating methods would still be needed to confirm a basic sequence.

Kotelny Island is located in the area known as Beringia, the submerged land bridge that once connected Siberia and North America. Albert Protopopov of the Russian Academy of Sciences said cut marks and chips left by darts were left on the mammoth’s bones when its muscles, trunk, and brain were removed and the bone marrow extracted from its limbs. He thinks the new dates indicate the animal may have been killed by a population that eventually migrated into North America. “Recent DNA research suggests that the split in the populations—and therefore the settlement—happened from around 25,000 years ago,” he said. “This is one of the most interesting things in the discovery of this mammoth, as it will add more information to our knowledge of how people gradually moved towards America.” Genetic study of the mammoth remains is planned.

GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA— Live Science reports that William Keegan of the Florida Museum of Natural History and Ann Ross of North Carolina State University analyzed the structure of 103 skulls unearthed in the Caribbean, Florida, and Panama, and concluded that the Carib people may have traveled to the Bahamas from South America as early as A.D. 800. When Christopher Columbus arrived in the Bahamas in 1492, he recorded conflicts between the indigenous Arawak and Caribs, whom he described as marauding cannibals. But researchers lacked evidence showing that the Caribs had actually migrated so far north, and therefore doubted the accuracy of the explorer’s account. The new test results and archaeological evidence suggest that Carib settlers from the Yucatán Peninsula reached the Caribbean around 5000 B.C., and they then traveled to Cuba and the northern Antilles, while Arawaks from Colombia and Venezuela arrived in Puerto Rico between 800 and 200 B.C. The study also indicates that Caribs from the northwest Amazon were the first to arrive in the Bahamas and the island of Hispaniola. Keegan said this migration pattern fits with the spread of a unique pottery type as well. He and Ross now think Columbus may have actually encountered the Caribs, but they said that there is still no real evidence that the Caribs practiced cannibalism. "

CANTERBURY, ENGLAND—Alastair Key of the University of Kent and his colleagues experimented with raw materials employed by toolmaking hominins who lived in Tanzania’s Olduvai Gorge, and found that our human ancestors were making complex decisions about tool design as early as 1.8 million years ago, according to a Cosmos Magazine report. Key said the study suggests that Early Stone Age toolmakers considered edge sharpness, cutting force, durability, and availability when choosing between different types of stone. For example, quartzite, Key explained, produced the sharpest tools, but was the least durable, and so was often chosen for flake tools, which are thought to have been used for short-term cutting activities. Chert, which was more durable than quartzite, produced tools that were almost as sharp, and was chosen for tools used for long periods of time. Hominins thus optimized their tools for specific circumstances, Key said. "

Nobunga captured it in 1567, after a two-week siege, and renovated the structure with stone walls whose gaps were filled with smaller stones. The surviving section of wall measures about six feet long and two feet tall, and matches historic descriptions. It had been previously thought that Nobunaga’s structure was completely torn down during reconstruction work in 1910. "

MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA—According to a statement released by West Virginia University , geographers Kristen de Graauw and Amy Hessl are using tree-ring dating of samples of wood taken from historic log structures to study forest ecology in the Appalachian Mountains, and its possible ties to the decrease in the Native American population in the region after the arrival of Europeans. The data suggests that fast-growing, second-growth forests appeared in the late seventeenth century, at about the time that Native Americans are thought to have abandoned their cleared land. A drought in the late seventeenth century in eastern North America may have also thinned forests and brought about a surge in regrowth, de Graauw explained. Hessl said further research, including analysis of samples from additional historic log buildings, dating of charcoal, and archaeological investigations, could help researchers understand what happened to Native American populations in eastern North America after European contact.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8347-200110-homo-erectus-chronology,Pre-Human,"New Dates for Arrival of Homo erectus in Southeast Asia. TOKYO, JAPAN—According to a Gizmodo report, Shuji Matsu’ura of Japan’s National Museum of Nature and Science and his colleagues have analyzed complex sediment deposits and created a new chronology for Sangiran, a site on the Indonesian island of Java where more than 100 hominin fossils have been found. The new dates, obtained through uranium-lead dating and fission-track dating, indicate Homo erectus reached Southeast Asia between 1.3 million and 1.5 million years ago, or about 300,000 to 500,000 years later than previously suggested by argon-argon dating. Because archaeological evidence points to the emergence of Homo erectus in Africa, the extremely old dates for Homo erectus in Java had created controversy among scholars over where the hominin could have originated. The new dates could help to resolve these inconsistencies. “This might not sound like a huge difference, but those 200,000 to 500,000 years swings the balance back to an African center of evolution for Homo erectus and helps to tie in the morphological changes seen between the younger and older hominins at Sangiran to a major climatic shift that occurred around 1.2 million years ago,” commented geochronologist Kira Westaway of Macquarie University.

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a CNN report, researchers led by Axel Petzold of University College London examined the Heslington brain, a 2,600-year-old organ discovered in a decapitated skull found in a clay-rich pit in northern England. Made up of more than 80 percent water, brains usually decompose quickly due to the action of enzymes present in human tissues. Petzold and his colleagues found that the outer areas of the Heslington brain still had proteins in place that normally act like scaffolding and maintain brain structure. But, the proteins had folded together even more tightly after death, and had caused the Heslington brain to shrink and become more compact. The scientists also observed this process in another brain about three months after death. They suggest that some sort of acidic fluid may have come in contact with the remains and deactivated the enzymes usually responsible for decomposition. Further research into such brain protein folding and unfolding could be useful for the study of neurodegenerative diseases, Petzold added. "

CENTRAL QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA— ABC Australia reports that ancient rock art at eastern Australia’s Carnarvon National Park was destroyed in 2018 when a walkway made of recycled plastic exploded during a bushfire. “Unfortunately, that’s sort of like solidified petroleum, and if you have a hot fire underneath it, it melts and then it just explodes into a ball of flame and that’s exactly what happened,” said Paul Taçon of Griffith University. Pieces of rock sloughed off Baloon Cave’s walls, along with the artwork, which included ancient handprints and more recent images. Dale Harding, a member of the Baloon Cave working group, called the lost artwork a link between generations of Bidjara, Ghungalu, and Garingbal people. Taçon suggests that only steel, or concrete and steel, be used to construct walkways at Australia’s cultural heritage sites. Government officials continue to review such structures. "

SOMERSET, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Guardian , a Roman-era cemetery containing the remains of some 50 adults and children has been discovered in southwest England. Most of the 2,000-year-old graves were lined and capped with slabs of local stone in a manner resembling local roof construction of the time. In one grave, the slabs were positioned to create a tent-like structure. The position of one woman’s skull in another grave suggests her head had been laid to rest on a pillow. Tiny nails recovered at the foot of many of the graves indicate that the occupants had been buried wearing hobnail boots. Jewelry, a coin minted during the first-century A.D. reign of the emperor Vespasian, a carved bone knife handle, and pottery were also recovered at the site. One of the pots contained a chicken wing bone. Steve Membery of the South West Heritage Trust said those who died during the Roman period may have lived and worked at a nearby villa. Older graves at the site, however, offer clues to the burial customs of local Britons before the Roman invasion. Analysis of DNA samples could reveal if Roman-era Britons adopted Roman burial customs, or if those buried in the Roman graves originated somewhere else. "

The drain once connected the fort’s Delhi Gate to the surrounding moat. Researchers are now removing silt from the drain, and then will strengthen it, so that it will once again be able to serve as a channel for rainwater.

The excavation, conducted ahead of strip mining for coal, uncovered nearly 2,500 archaeological sites over an area of about 100 square miles. Millions of Navajo, Hopi, and ancient Puebloan artifacts dating back as early as 8,000 years ago, in addition to more than 200 sets of human remains, were recovered. The project, which has been paid for by the mining company, has allowed scholars to study the cultural history of the region in depth. Representatives of the Navajo, the Hopi, and the university are now looking for a home in the Southwest for the artifacts. “It’s an amazing time, because the relationships between the tribes and the archaeological community are totally different than they were a decade ago,” commented Kim Spurr of the Museum of Northern Arizona. “People are complying with the tribes and understanding why this is important.” "

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA—According to a statement released by the University of the Witwatersrand , researchers including scientists Lyn Wadley and Christine Sievers have found evidence that early modern humans collected and cooked starchy plant parts known as rhizomes some 170,000 years ago. The charred rhizomes were recovered from fireplaces and ash dumps at South Africa’s Border Cave, which is located in the Lebombo Mountains, and identified with a scanning electron microscope as Hypoxis , a plant also known as the Yellow Star flower. The researchers suggests that a wooden digging stick discovered in the cave may have been used to dig such rhizomes out of the ground. Wadley also explained that cooking the rhizomes would have made them easier to peel and digest. She thinks that since the rhizomes were cooked in the cave, rather than in the field, they may have been shared with others who shared the cave as a home base. Today, the plant is still valued for the nutrition, energy, and fiber it provides. "

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a Discover Magazine report, symptoms of atherosclerosis, or hardening and narrowing of the arteries, have been detected in the mummified remains of four Inuit adults who lived in Greenland some 500 years ago. It has been previously suggested that a diet rich in marine foods and omega-3 fatty acids, such as that eaten by preindustrial-era Inuit peoples, would offer protection from arterial calcifications. Scientists led by Samuel Wann, a physician in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, used computerized tomography to examine the bodies of the two men, who are thought to have been between 18 and 22 and 25 and 30 at the time of death, and two women, who died sometime between the ages of 16 and 18 and 25 and 30. The individuals’ entire circulatory systems were not preserved, however, so the researchers were not able to determine the full extent of the damage to their arteries. The scientists also noted that heavy exposure to smoke from indoor fires may have outweighed the heart-health benefits of an active lifestyle and fatty-fish-based diet. "

Earlier this year, a second lower molar with three roots was identified in a Denisovan mandible discovered on the Tibetan Plateau. Shara Bailey of New York University and her colleagues suggested that that unusual tooth may be evidence of a link between Denisovans and modern Asian populations, where as many as 40 percent of people have three-rooted molars, compared to just 3.5 percent of non-Asians. The new CENIEH-led study points out that it is the first molar, and not the second, where a three-rooted tooth is more likely to be found in today’s Asian populations. Martinón-Torres and her colleagues also note that the third root found in the first molars of modern Asian populations has a different size, shape, and position than the Denisovan third root in the second molar. The scientists thus conclude that the genetic variation that produced the three-rooted molar in Denisovans is probably different from the one that causes three-rooted molars in modern populations. "

The lump may have been chewed to make it more malleable to use as glue, or to relieve a toothache. Analysis of the genetic material indicates the chewer was a woman likely to have had dark skin, dark hair, and blue eyes, who was more closely related to hunter-gatherers in mainland Europe than those living in central Scandinavia. Plant and animal DNA recovered from the gum suggest she ate hazelnuts and mallard duck. Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen said DNA from oral microbes was also retrieved from the pitch. The pathogens include those that cause glandular fever, pneumonia, in addition to other viruses and bacteria usually found in the mouth. “To be able to recover these types of ancient pathogen genomes from material like this is quite exciting because we can study how they evolved and how they are different to strains that are present nowadays,” Schroeder said.

BOLOGNA, ITALY— Live Science reports that archaeologists led by Max Victor David of the University of Bologna have excavated a 1,600-year-old temple in Ostia thought to have been dedicated to several deities. The temple may have been primarily dedicated to the Zoroastrian god Mithras, whose cult the Romans imported from the East. Mithras is said to have been an excellent archer and is usually associated with light and sun. Paintings of tridents and arrows were found in one of the temple’s rooms. An inscription in the mithraeum mentions Mithras and Kronos, Greek god of harvest and time, suggesting Kronos may also have been venerated at the site. An Egyptian ivory handle, usually associated with the goddess Isis, points to her worship as well. David said banquets, initiation ceremonies, and animal sacrifices associated with Mithraism would have taken place in the building, and the participants may have achieved an altered state of consciousness through the use of psychotropic plants. In the mithraeum’s spelaeum , a room intended to resemble a cave, the researchers uncovered a floor made of pieces of multicolored marble, a bench, a ritual well, and a possible flower bed.

Éloi Bérubé of McMaster University and Guy Hepp of California State University, San Bernardino, said the plants mark the transition from foraging to agriculture, living in permanent settlements, and social complexity. Some of the plants, such as the maize, had been processed into different parts and cooked. Traces of maize and wild beans were also detected on burial offerings. "

CINCINNATI, OHIO—Archaeologists from the University of Cincinnati have excavated two Bronze Age tombs at the ancient site of Pylos in Greece, according to a report in the New York Times . The burials were first discovered during investigations of an area around the grave of an individual the team called the ""Griffin Warrior,"" who was initially found in 2015 and named for a mythological creature engraved on an ivory plaque in his tomb. In addition to armor, weaponry, and gold jewelry, that burial notably included an agate sealstone depicting combat between two warriors in exquisitely crafted detail. Like the Griffin Warrior grave, one of the the newly reported tombs also contained a sealstone, this time featuring two lion-like creatures called genii standing on clawed feet. The researchers also unearthed thousands of flakes of gold leaf that once papered the tombs' walls, amber from the Baltic, imported carnelian, and a gold pendant with an engraved depiction of the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor dating to the 15th century B.C. The artifacts suggest that Pylos may have been a much more important stop along the Bronze Age Mediterranean trade route than was once thought. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8296-191216-mexico-maya-bones,Pre-Columbian,"Bones of Possible Maya Prisoners of War Analyzed. BONN, GERMANY—Researchers including Nicolaus Seefeld of the University of Bonn and scientists at the Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico have analyzed human remains recovered from a 1,400-year-old mass grave in a well at Mexico’s Maya site of Uxul. The collection of bones represents at least 20 people, including 14 men, one woman, adolescents, and an 18-month-old child who was decapitated and dismembered. Heat marks indicate the remains had been exposed to fire, perhaps to assist with the removal of skin and flesh from the bones. Different regions of the world have characteristic strontium isotope ratios in their soils, which are reflected in the ratios of strontium isotopes in a person’s tooth enamel. Because tooth enamel is formed during childhood, the process allows scientists to determine where an individual grew up. Strontium analysis of the teeth of 13 of these individuals indicates that some of them grew up at least 95 miles away, in what is now Guatemala. At least one adult and one infant were local residents of Uxul. Overall, eight of the individuals are thought to have been of high social status, since they had elaborate jade tool jewelry or engravings in their incisors. Seefeld and his colleagues suggest the treatment of the remains was a demonstration of power over prisoners of war. "

EDMONTON, CANADA— Live Science reports that researchers led by Robert Losey of the University of Alberta examined more than 90 atlatls and fragments of such weapons recovered from the Par-Tee shell midden in the 1960s and 1970s. Located on the northern coast of Oregon, the site was created by Native Americans more than 1,000 years ago. Careful measurement of the atlatls, which were carved from whale bone with a grip at one end and a hook for a dart on the other, revealed that the largest was 166 percent bigger than the smallest, a size difference much larger than the variations found among adult-sized hands. Thus, the researchers suggest the smaller weapons were used by children to master the skill of dart throwing, which would have been critical to their survival. Previous tests conducted with smaller atlatls found the weapons to be highly effective, in that they could hurl a dart some 100 feet. "

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA— In-Cyprus reports that Craig Barker of the University of Sydney and his colleagues investigated Roman infrastructure in the vicinity of the theater at the site of Nea Paphos, which is located in southwest Cyprus. The theater was constructed in 300 B.C. for dramatic performances and was eventually used by the Romans as an arena that could be flooded for water spectacles. In A.D. 365, the theater was destroyed by an earthquake. The recent investigations exposed the Roman road to the south of the theater. It was constructed with limestone pavers, ran east-west to the city’s northeastern gate, measured nearly 28 feet wide, and was equipped with a drainage system. Wheel ruts in the road indicate it was used by vehicular as well as foot traffic. Barker and his team also found debris of the fourth-century earthquake on the road surface, and evidence that its stone blocks were reused in later periods. Some 100 feet to the south, evidence of a pathway covered in rubble was uncovered, along with building foundations and fragments of painted plaster. Barker said the position of the road and the pathway helped to confirm the size of city blocks in the region around the theater. "

POCKLINGTON, ENGLAND—Conservation of a Celtic warrior’s bronze shield discovered in an Iron Age cemetery in the north of England in 2017 has revealed its scalloped border and detailed decorations, according to an Artnet News report. The shield measures 30 inches across and is thought to have been produced between 320 and 174 B.C. by the La Tène Culture. It was found next to the skeletal remains of a man thought to have been more than 45 years of age at the time of his death. He had also been buried with an intact chariot, a brooch made of bronze and red glass, six pigs, and two horses whose bodies had been arranged to suggest they were leaping. Called “the most important British Celtic art object of the millennium” by Melanie Giles of the University of Manchester, the shield bears swirling images of mollusk shells and a raised center that was hammered into the object from the opposite side. A sword puncture hole and signs of repairs were also detected during the conservation work. Paula Ware of MAP Archaeological Practice said the damage challenges the idea that such elaborate items were made for ceremonial use alone. "

Mostafa Waziri of the Supreme Council of Antiquities said the pharaoh, who ruled from about 1279 to 1213 B.C., is shown wearing a wig with the “Ka” symbol, which represented power, life force, and spirit, over his head. The statue stands about 3.5 feet tall and nearly two feet wide. Engravings on red granite and limestone blocks that were also excavated at the site show Ramesses II participating in the Heb-Sed ceremony, which celebrated the continued rule of the pharaoh. The researchers suggest the blocks may have been part of a temple dedicated to the creator god Ptah. The sculptures have been moved to the Mit Rahina open air museum for restoration. "

QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA—According to a Cosmos Magazine report, cave art discovered in Indonesia’s region of Sulawesi has been dated to at least 44,000 years old by a team of researchers led by Maxime Aubert of Griffith University, who measured the amount of uranium and thorium in the calcium carbonate deposited over the painting. Aubert said the imaginative images, which depict the pursuit of wild pigs and dwarf buffaloes by humans with animal tails or bird heads, were painted about 65 feet above ground level. “We have a narrative scene—the first evidence of storytelling,” he explained. In comparison, Aubert said hunting scenes in France’s Lascaux Cave have been dated to about 17,000 years ago. The researchers also think the possible hunting scene includes ropes tied around the neck of a pig, hinting at an early attempt at animal domestication. "

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA— Science News reports that remnants of two cone-shaped headpieces have been found for the first time in burials in the ancient Egyptian city of Amarna by archaeologist Anna Stevens of Monash University and her colleagues. When depicted in paintings, the cones adorn the heads of prominent and powerful individuals, so some archaeologists have expected to find such cones in elite graves, and speculated that they may have been scented. In the 3,300-year-old graves at Amarna, however, one cone was discovered on the head of a woman who died in her 20s, while the other was found with the remains of a person of undetermined sex who died between the ages of 15 and 20. Their names and occupations are unknown, Stevens said. Examination of the cone remnants with portable infrared and X-ray machines showed that they were made of wax and were hollow, but the researchers have found no trace of scented resins or perfumes, which may have evaporated, in the artifacts so far. Stevens suggests the headgear may have been intended to provide assistance in the afterlife. "

LOM, BULGARIA— Archaeology in Bulgaria reports that traces of a first-century A.D. fort, including part of a fortress wall, a street with a canal, and a small barracks, have been uncovered at the ancient city of Almus, which is located on the Danube River in northwestern Bulgaria. It had been previously thought that the Romans first built a fortress at the site in the late third or early fourth century A.D. Valeri Stoichkov of the Lom Museum of History explained that the barracks was just large enough to house a contubernium, the smallest unit of soldiers in the Roman army. Inside the structure, which had been burned down, researchers uncovered a gold phalera —a medal awarded to military officers—as well as fragments of pottery from Italy and Gaul. By the second or third century A.D., a luxurious roofed building, plastered and painted in Pompeian red, stood on the site. It may have served as housing for senior officers and as a customs office.

BORNHOLM, DENMARK—According to a report in Live Science , a small piece of copper has been found at the 5,000-year-old Vasagard archaeological site, which may have been a center of sun worship during the Neolithic period. The site consists of traces of several round timber structures within an earthen-wall enclosure. Hand-sized, polished stones inscribed with connected radiating lines resembling spider webs, and fragments of stones that may have been inscribed with symbolic maps, have also been recovered from the site. The piece of copper was found in what had been one of ten postholes for the largest timber structure. Michael Thorsen of the Bornholm Museum said the metal may have been part of a larger ax that had been buried as part of a sacrifice. He suggests the ax had not been made locally, but was imported from the Mediterranean or the Balkans, where people were producing copper objects at that time. The building may have been used for rituals or as a place for housing the dead before it was ceremonially demolished and its postholes filled in with burned grain, burned stone axes, and the copper ax. “For me, it just makes the structure even more important, because they were offering a rare piece of copper like this,” Thorsen said.

JENA, GERMANY—Jennifer Miller of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and Elizabeth Sawchuk of Stony Brook University tested the idea that the size of beads made from ostrich eggshells can be used to track cultural shifts in ancient Africa, according to a statement released by the Max Planck Institute . Such beads date back to more than 40,000 years ago and have been unearthed throughout Africa. Miller and Sawchuk measured 1,200 beads recovered from 30 archaeological sites spanning a 10,000 year period in southern and eastern Africa and compared the data with other archaeological evidence of cultural change. The researchers confirmed that larger beads appeared in southern Africa some 2,000 years ago, when people began to herd sheep and goats, but did not replace existing bead styles. The larger bead size may have been introduced by the people who brought domesticated animals to the region, they explained. In eastern Africa, however, bead styles did not change at the time herding was introduced, although beads made by foragers in eastern Africa were similarly sized to the larger beads made by herders in southern Africa. The researchers conclude that peoples from southern and eastern Africa may have had contact with each other as herding spread, but the experience did not extinguish local traditions. "

MILAN, ITALY—Massimo Osanna, director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, and Luisa Ferro and Giulio Magli of the Polytechnic University of Milan, suggest that images in a floor mosaic in a Pompeian house may be related to the practice of surveying, according to information released by the Polytechnic University of Milan . Roman survey technicians, known as gromatici , employed a cross-shaped instrument called a groma . A cord hanging from each of the perpendicular arms of the cross ended with a weight or plumb bob that could be used to create plumb lines. Thus, the tool allowed surveyors to establish true vertical and horizontal lines when planning towns and aqueducts. One groma has been uncovered at Pompeii, but their use has only been known from texts dating to the medieval period. Osanna and his colleagues explained that one of the mosaic images in the House of Orion resembles those seen in a medieval text. It consists of a square inscribed in a circle, which is cut by two perpendicular lines. One of the lines aligns with the longitudinal axis of the structure’s atrium. A second image, made up of a circle inscribed with a cross, appears to depict a groma. The researchers think the owner of the home may have belonged to the surveyors' guild, or the structure may have been used for guild meetings. "

CARDIFF, WALES— Cardiff University announced that researcher Philip Staudigel and his colleagues at the University of Miami and Valencia College studied possible cooking techniques used by the first residents of the island of Puerto Rico some 2,500 years ago. The scientists employed a type of chemical analysis known as clumped isotope geochemistry to analyze some 45 pounds of fossilized clamshells, and found that some of the shellfish were exposed to high heat, as if they had been barbecued, rather than boiled in water at a lower temperature. Staudigel suggests that pottery technology, which would have been necessary for boiling the clams in water, may not have been in widespread use. Some of the clams had been exposed to lower levels of heat, he added. They may have been placed on top of clams that had been placed directly over cooking fires. "

Other rare organic materials, believed to have been tossed into the pit in the late third century A.D., include leather shoes, wooden tools, and a basketry tray made of woven oak bands and willow rods. Biddulph suggested that bread placed on the tray and the eggs may have been cast into the pit as an offering during a funeral procession. "

EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS—According to a report in The Guardian , a population study conducted by Krist Vaesen of Eindhoven University of Technology and his colleagues suggests the arrival of modern humans in Europe may not have triggered the demise of Neanderthals some 40,000 years ago. When modern humans arrived in Europe some 60,000 years ago, the Neanderthal population is thought to have numbered between 10,000 and 70,000 individuals. Vaesen said the models explored what might have happened to Neanderthal populations over a period of 10,000 years, factoring in the possible impact of inbreeding; natural fluctuations in birth rates, deaths, and sex ratios; and so-called Allee effects, which hamper the growth of small populations through limited mate choice and a lack of hunters and caregivers. Inbreeding, which harms the fitness of the population, may have been the sole cause of Neanderthal extinction, Vaesen explained, although in one scenario explored by the researchers, modern humans could have contributed to Neanderthal extinction by simply being present in the environment and isolating different Neanderthal groups. “It has nothing to do with competition or superiority, it’s more of a fragmentation of the habitat,” he said.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8272-191206-roman-lead-levels,Roman,"Study Suggests Roman Britons Suffered from Toxic Lead Levels. MADISON, WISCONSIN— Chemistry World reports that environmental health scientist Sean Scott of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues analyzed the amount of lead in bones recovered from three cemeteries in Britain’s Roman settlement of Londinium (modern London) and found it to be 70 times higher than the level of lead found in pre-Roman bones unearthed in the Hampshire and Yorkshire regions of England. The level of lead in the bones from Londinium was high enough to have affected the health of urban Romans, Scott explained, and may have even impacted their birth rates through reduced sperm levels, stillbirths, and premature births. Scott suggests Romans were exposed to lead through lead plumbing, though it was not widely used in Roman London, lead drinking vessels, and even through the use of lead acetate as a food sweetener. Critics of the study note that bone can absorb lead and other metals from soil, making it hard to rule out contamination after death. "

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS— The International Business Times reports that two large mudbrick buildings dating to Egypt’s Fifth Dynasty have been unearthed at Tel Edfu by a team of researchers led by Nadine Moeller and Gregory Marouard of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago. One of the structures still had its rare and expensive wooden door, and the outer façade of the larger one was designed with an unusual slope. The buildings were part of a larger complex of open courtyards, workshops, and storage areas where more than 200 broken clay seals, which were used to mark boxes, containers, and letters, were found. The researchers think areas in the structures might have been used for making beer and bread, and for smelting copper. The buildings may have also housed officials who came from the capital in Memphis to inspect the mining of metals and gems in the surrounding desert. Moeller said the unique finds suggest the city of Edfu may have been becoming more important during the late Fifth Dynasty, perhaps as a departure point for expeditions to the deserts to the east, and maybe even the Red Sea shore, which is about 125 miles to the east.

ROME, ITALY—According to an Inside Science report, analysis of planks discovered in the waterlogged foundation of an ancient villa unearthed near the Tiber River in central Rome indicates that the wood was imported from France. Dendrochronologist Mauro Bernabei of Italy’s National Research Council said the 13-foot-long planks’ growth rings indicate that four of the trees were more than 250 years old when they were felled, and their growth patterns match those of trees known to have grown in the Jura Mountains of northeastern France, more than 1,000 miles away from Rome. Analysis of sapwood found in some of the planks suggests the trees were cut down between A.D. 40 and 60. The wood was likely to have been transported down the Saône and Rhône rivers to the Mediterranean Sea, and then up the Tiber River to Rome, where the demand for high-quality wood is likely to have depleted local trees. “The timber found in other important sites—Pompeii, Herculaneum—may be of foreign origin,” Bernabei added.

ZHENGZHOU, CHINA— Xinhua reports that researchers led by Zhao Feng of the China National Silk Museum developed a technique called enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the presence of silk in carbonized residue in a burial at the Neolithic Wanggou site in central China. The fabric is thought to have been used to wrap the body before it was placed in a silkworm pupa-shaped coffin for burial. Zhao thinks the shape of the coffin may have been intended to evoke rebirth after death in the same manner that a silk moth breaks through its cocoon. Gu Wanfa of the Zhengzhou Municipal Research Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology explained that the fabrics at Wanggou indicate that silk production was well developed in China between 5,300 and 5,500 years ago. Examination of the sample with an electron microscope revealed fine yarns woven with four-warp twisted rods, and the yarns had been dyed before they were woven into fabric, which was then “cooked” to prevent the dye from fading, Gu added.

ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND—Environmental historians Lee Mordechai and Merle Eisenberg of the University of Maryland argue that the outbreak of bubonic plague during the reign of Roman Emperor Justinian in the mid-sixth century A.D. was not a catastrophic event across the Mediterranean region, according to a Science News report. Historians have long blamed the Justinianic plague outbreak as a contributing factor in the decline of the Roman Empire. But Mordechai and his colleagues cite historical texts and archaeological evidence—including a lack of increase in the number of mass graves, the continued cultivation of farmland near eastern Mediterranean trade routes, few plague references in historical texts and stone inscriptions, and stable coin circulation during the sixth century—as support for the idea that the outbreak of disease had a modest impact on social structure. Additionally, samples of the Yersinia pestis bacteria obtained from sixth century skeletons have not been found to be ancestral to the strain of Y. pestis responsible for the devastation of the Black Death in the fourteenth century.

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA— The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology have handed over another batch of clay tablets to officials at the Iraqi Embassy in Washington, D.C. The fragments are part of a collection of some 7,500 tablets that were excavated from the ancient Mesopotamian city of Ur by a team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum between 1922 and 1934, under the direction of Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, who is recognized as one of the first archaeologists to excavate methodically and keep meticulous records. The tablets have since been held at the Penn Museum under a loan agreement with the government of Iraq. So far, more than 3,000 of the tablets have been repatriated. Penn Museum research associate William B. Hafford said most of them are records of traded goods that have helped scholars understand how various items were valued against each other and and against silver. This particular batch of 400 small tablet fragments, thought to have been used as rubble to support a brick floor in a house at Ur, has been difficult to study, Hafford explained. “At this point, we realize we have had them too long and that even though they carry some information, it will take many more years for specialists to do that work.” "

DEBELT, BULGARIA— Archaeology in Bulgaria reports that some 6,000 pieces of chain mail dating to sometime between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D. have been unearthed in the ancient Roman colony of Deultum, which is located near the Black Sea coast in southeastern Bulgaria. The armor, which includes two well-preserved sleeves, was found inside the colony’s fortress, against its north wall. Fragments of wood suggest the armor was stored in wooden chests. When the north wall collapsed during a fire, the armor, made up of rectangular slabs of wrought iron attached to leather garments, was crushed. So far, analysis of the artifacts suggests the armor had been made by two or three different craftsmen. Conservation of the rare artifacts will be challenging. “This requires an incredible amount of work because every single slab has to be extracted, any corrosion needs to be cleaned up, and then the slab needs to be restored and placed on leather, the way it used to be,” explained Krasimira Kostova of the Deultum-Debelt Archaeological Preserve. Bronze coins, pins, and the bones of large guard dogs were also recovered from the fortress. "

Mostafa Waziri of the Supreme Council of Antiquities said the lion mummies are the first of their kind to be found in Egypt, and, because they measure only about three feet long, the animals may not have been fully grown at the time of death. The mummies of three other large cats found near the lions have not yet been identified, but may represent leopards, cheetahs, or other big cat species. The decorated statues were made of stone, wood, and bronze, and some were inlaid with gold. A small ebony statue of Neith, goddess of the city of Sais, the capital of Egypt during the 26th dynasty, helped the researchers date the tomb and its contents, Waziri explained. "

VICTORIA, CANADA—John Peter Oleson of the University of Victoria suggests that a 1,300-year-old piece of carved sandstone recovered at Humayma, an early Islamic trade outpost in southern Jordan, may be a chess piece, Science News reports. Oleson said the palm-sized piece of rock has horn-like projections resembling a rook, or castle. Historical accounts of the game indicate it originated in India at least 1,400 years ago. The game may have been carried westward along trade routes, Oleson explained. “Chess became very popular in the early Islamic world,” he added. "

CANAKKALE, TURKEY— The Anadolu Agency reports that a monument thought to be 8,000 years old has been discovered in northwestern Turkey’s Ugurlu-Zeytinlik mound by a team of researchers led by Burcin Erdogu of Trakya University. The T-shaped monument resembles standing stones at the 10,000-year-old site of Göbekli Tepe, which is located in southeastern Turkey, Erdogu said. He explained that the structure at Ugurlu-Zeytinlik looks like an obelisk made up of two pieces of stone—a four-sided tapering base topped with a pyramidion. The structure is supported by 23-foot-long walls, he added. Erdogu thinks people may have gathered at such monumental structures for activities and rituals. “This structure is an important discovery both for the Aegean islands and western Anatolia,” Erdogu concluded.

Carved from wooly mammoth ivory, the fragment, which measures about 1.6 inches long and less than one-half inch tall, depicts the animal’s shoulders, belly, and hip. The hip is extended as if the lion is in motion. The figurine was decorated with notches and painted with red ochre. Shunkov and his team suggest the ivory for the statuette came from the northern foothills of the Altai Mountains, some 60 miles away. It is not clear at this time if the object was carved by Denisovans or by modern humans. "

LAMBAYEQUE, PERU— Live Science reports that archaeologist Edgar Bracamonte of the Royal Tombs of Sipan Museum and his colleagues have discovered a 3,000-year-old temple at the site of Huaca El Toro in northwestern Peru’s Zaña Valley. The temple, built on a foundation of cone-shaped clay with large, carved stones carried to the site from mountains located about two miles away, is situated between two rivers, and is thought to have been used for fertility rituals by a water cult. Small wells called pocitos , which were hollowed out of rocks near the temple, may have helped to predict rainy seasons, Bracamonte said. A man was buried at the temple with a ceramic bottle with two spouts and a bridge handle during this period, he added. The temple was abandoned around 250 B.C., but the Chumy people reused the site as a cemetery around A.D. 1300. The team has uncovered 20 Chumy graves so far. "

DENTON, TEXAS— The University of North Texas announced that an international team of scientists including archaeologist and geologist Reid Ferring developed a way to identify a species of creatures that lived more than one million years ago by analyzing proteins extracted from fossils. Ferring explained that proteins can survive in fossilized collagen from tendons, ligaments, skin, bone, and teeth for a longer period of time than DNA, which is limited to about 200,000 years. To test the process, scientists extracted protein from a 1.7-million-year-old rhinoceros tooth found under a 20-foot layer of volcanic ash at the Dmanisi site in the country of Georgia, and determined it belonged to a Stephanorhinus , an extinct type of rhino. The team members were also able to fit this individual into the modern rhino’s evolutionary line. Such information could help scientists identify evolutionary links between early hominins and modern humans, Ferring explained. "

The artifacts include fragments of urns, cremated remains, and 200 pieces of corroded iron making up four swords, nine spears or javelins, and brooches known as fibulae. Bits of bone, stone, and pottery items were also recovered. “We do not know exactly how many graves were in the cemetery, because our research is still in an initial stage,” Bulas said. “The graves are destroyed and often spread over a large area of the field.” However, Bulas and his team estimate that there were at least 20 burials in an area measuring about 2,100 square feet. The cemetery also featured squares carved into the soil and oriented by the cardinal directions. Fragments of pottery and metal objects had been placed in the squares, Bulas explained. He thinks the squares may have been used to designate family space within the cemetery. Further research could help identify the cultural identity of the people who were buried there, he added. "

CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA—Sara Juengst of the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, and her colleagues discovered the remains of two infants who had been buried some 2,100 years ago wearing “helmets” crafted from the crania of other children, according to a Live Science report. The infants’ remains, discovered with nine other burials in central Ecuador, were interred not long after a volcanic eruption had covered the region in ash. Lesions on the bones indicate the infants and children had all suffered from stress, perhaps brought on by malnutrition. A human hand bone was found between the head of one of the infants and its “helmet.” The researchers plan to extract and analyze DNA and strontium isotopes from the bones to try to determine if the hand bone belonged to any of the infants or children. Stone figurines thought to depict ancestors were also found in the burials, leading the researchers to speculate that the “helmets” may have been intended to offer the infants protection and empowerment. More study is necessary to determine if the burials were part of a ritual response to the environmental impact of the eruption, the researchers explained. "

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT—Scientists led by Ashish Sinha of California State University, Dominguez Hills, analyzed and dated mineral deposits in two stalagmites taken from northern Iraq’s Kuna Ba Cave and determined that the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the seventh century B.C. coincided with a shift from a wet climate to a dry one, according to a report in The Guardian . Centered in what is now northern Iraq, the ancient empire stretched from modern Iran to Egypt and the Persian Gulf. The empire and its capital city, Nineveh, experienced higher than average levels of rainfall between 850 and 740 B.C., which encouraged the production of plentiful crops and the expansion of the empire. Megadrought conditions between 675 and 550 B.C., however, would have intensified the unrest caused by civil war, overexpansion, and military defeat. Sinha noted that modern droughts are at least as severe as these ancient ones. "

Greek wine cup decorated with black-figured athletes on a red clay background to the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. Discovered in a tomb in central Greece, the cup was awarded to water carrier Spyros Louis, who won the first modern marathon in 1896. Georgios Kivvadias, director of vase collections for the museum, said there is no record of the vase from that time until it appeared in the collection of archaeologist Werner Peek, who was working at the German Archaeological Institute in Athens. Peek, a known Nazi sympathizer and anti-Semite, entrusted the collection of artifacts to notorious Nazi leader Hermann Göring when he visited Athens in 1934. Göring smuggled the objects out of the country in diplomatic pouches, and Peek recovered them when he returned to Germany in 1937. Peek eventually sold the artifacts to the University of Münster in the late 1980s. The cup will be transferred to the Museum of the History of the Ancient Olympic Games at Olympia sometime next year.

QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA—According to a Cosmos Magazine report, paleogeneticist Sally Wasef of Griffith University and her colleagues analyzed DNA extracted from the mummified remains of African sacred ibises and found it unlikely that the ancient Egyptians raised the birds in hatcheries or farms. The remains of at least several million Threskiornis aethiopicus , mummified between 600 B.C. and A.D. 250, have been recovered from ancient temples dedicated to Thoth, the ibis-headed god of wisdom. Ibis mummies are thought to have been available for purchase at the temples, where they were put on display as offerings, and then eventually moved into tunnels and storage rooms beneath the temples. The 40 DNA samples in the study were collected from five such catacombs. Wasef and her team members were able to recover mitochondrial genomes from 14 of them, and found that none of these birds were closely related to each other through the maternal line, as they would have been if they had been bred in captivity for generations. She suggests the priests of Thoth captured wild birds or collected their eggs seasonally, then raised the chicks for eventual mummification without trying to breed them. Threskiornis aethiopicus is now extinct in Egypt. "

BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA—Researchers from the Department of Energy/Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they have worked with scholars from the University of Cairo to analyze samples of mummified bone and soil collected at sites in Egypt where human remains were found, in an effort to determine if chemicals in the bone reflected the person’s daily activities, or if the soil chemistry had changed the composition of the bones over time. The analysis was conducted with X-ray and infrared light-based techniques. The mummified bone samples, which range from 2,000 to 4,000 years old, came from the burial ground at Saqqara in northern Egypt, and Aswan, an ancient city located in southern Egypt. Mohamed Kasem of Cairo University said the researchers detected lead, aluminum, and other elements in the bones that they think reflect the toxicity of the ancient Egyptian environment. The aluminum is thought to have come from the potassium alum compound added to drinking water to reduce cloudiness, while the lead in the bones is likely to have come from the lead used to polish pottery. Kasem said the team of researchers is continuing to experiment with different high-tech techniques to sort out the sources of elements found in the ancient bones. "

ITHACA, NEW YORK— Gizmodo reports that archaeologists examined 12,000-year-old mammoth footprints at New Mexico’s White Sands National Monument with ground-penetrating radar, and detected additional prints left by at least one human as well as giant ground sloth tracks that were not visible to the naked eye. Led by Thomas Urban of Cornell University and Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University, the team first covered the mammoth prints with foam pads so that they would not have to drag the ground-penetrating radar device directly over the tracks. Urban and Bennett said the data indicates that a human walked north, and then the mammoth walked west, stepping on one of the human footprints. A human walking south, parallel to the earlier tracks, then stepped into one of the mammoth prints, all within a short time span. Bennett said the scans also revealed variations of pressure across the footprints. “It is this last bit which is perhaps the most important aspect,” he explained. “It is the equivalent to taking an extinct animal, bringing it back to life, taking it to the biochemics lab and getting it to walk on a pressure plate.” "

ROME, ITALY—Alfredo Coppa of the Sapienza University of Rome, Ron Pinhasi of the University of Vienna, and Jonathan Pritchard of Stanford University have found traces of Rome’s immigration history in the genomes of 127 people who were buried at 29 different archaeological sites in and around the city over a period of about 12,000 years, according to a Science Magazine report. The genomes of hunter-gathers who lived in the region between 12,000 and 9,000 years ago resembled those of other hunter-gatherers in Europe, the scientists explained, and also reflect the arrival of early farmers from Anatolia. But from 900 to 200 B.C., as the city grew, the residents’ genomes began to reflect ancestry from the Middle East and Africa. During the imperial period, the Roman population's genetic “diversity was just overwhelming,” Pinhasi said, as immigrants came from Greece, Syria, and Lebanon, as well as from Europe, North Africa, and other places in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. After the fourth century A.D., however, the diversity of Rome’s population decreased as trade shifted to the new capital in Constantinople and epidemics and invasions took their toll. By the Middle Ages, Rome’s population once again genetically resembled that of other parts of Europe. "

The straight-sided pits, which measure nearly six feet deep and 80 feet in diameter, are thought to have been dug as traps to catch the enormous herbivores, according to Pedro Francisco Sánchez Nava of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History. It had been previously thought that Pleistocene hunters only occasionally killed mammoths when they found them trapped in bogs or swamps. Numerous traps were probably dug in a line in order to increase the chances of capturing an animal, added archaeologist Luis Córdoba Barradas. He suggests that groups of 20 to 30 hunters might have separated an individual mammoth from a herd with torches and branches and then driven it toward the traps. "

TÜBINGEN, GERMANY— Live Science reports that the 11-million-year-old fossils of four or more individuals from a previously unknown great ape species have been discovered in southeastern Germany. Paleontologist Madelaine Böhme of the University of Tübingen said the anatomy of the species, dubbed Danuvius guggenmosi , points to a previously unknown style of locomotion that may offer clues to the evolution of bipedal walking. The 21 bones of a male Danuvius guggenmosi indicate the creature weighed between 37 and 68 pounds, and had human-like legs with grasping toes and elongated, ape-like arms that would have allowed it to move easily through the tree tops. But, in all, the creatures’ fingers were not as robust as those found in chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas, who use their knuckles while walking. Böhme thinks Danuvius moved by a process of “extended limb clambering,” and would have been able to stand in the treetops by grasping small branches with its toes. “ Danuvius is like an ape and a hominin in one,” she explained.

KIRKWALL, SCOTLAND—DNA analysis of whalebone artifacts unearthed at two Iron Age sites in the Orkney Islands has revealed that a vertebra—hollowed out to fashion a vessel containing a human jawbone and the remains of two newborn lambs—came from a giant fin whale, according to a BBC News report. Giant fin whales can grow to nearly 90 feet long, and are second in size only to the blue whale, the world’s largest known animal. Martin Carruthers of the University of the Highlands and Islands said the vessel had been placed just outside the broch, or stone roundhouse, at The Cairns on the island of South Ronaldsay, in the mid-second century A.D., at about the time the broch was put out of use. Two sets of red deer antlers had been set alongside the whale vertebra vessel and held in place against the broch wall with a quern stone. Carruthers said the animal might have beached itself, or may have been stranded in shallow water, since scholars have different opinions as to whether or not Iron Age hunters would have been able to take down such a large marine mammal.

Boulders used in the construction of Newgrange and Knowth were probably moved up and down the river on rafts, rather than log boats, according to Stephen Davis of University College Dublin. Fishing weirs were also detected in the survey, he added. Davis said the non-invasive survey, when combined with airborne laser scanning surveys of the monuments, will help researchers understand the Neolithic landscape. “For an observer from the river, the ridge on which Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth are located would have formed a northern barrier beyond which there was no visibility,” he said. “To the south the steep slopes again block the observer’s views.” "

ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA—An international team of archaeologists led by Ian Moffat of Flinders University has discovered a flawed water management system that led to the decline of Koh Ker, an ancient Cambodian city that briefly served as the capital of the Khmer Empire in the mid-tenth century A.D. Using ground penetrating radar, the researchers mapped a four-mile buried spillway designed to catch water from the Stung Rongea river, and calculated the velocity of water channeled into the city’s large reservoir. They found that the catchment was insufficient to handle the water flow, causing the reservoir’s dike to fail during the first rainy season following its construction. Moffat explained that the failure of such a massive infrastructure project would have been a threat to the legitimacy of the Khmer king Jayavarman IV, and may have prompted the relocation of the imperial capital to Angkor, which was located 56 miles to the south of Koh Ker.

At the hunter-gatherer village known as Boncuklu, Douglas Baird of the University of Liverpool and his colleagues discovered stone tools, burned seeds, wheat chaff, and weeds known to have grown in early farmers’ fields. An abundance of pests also suggests the residents of Boncuklu farmed. Bones from the site suggest they kept sheep and goats. But the tools at Boncuklu and other sites in central Anatolia are unlike those found at other early farming sites in the Fertile Crescent, suggesting the Levantine farmers did not replace the Anatolians. “In addition, the ancient DNA evidence now clearly shows that there is a distinctive local gene pool in the early Neolithic at places like Boncuklu, different from the genetics of Levantine Neolithic populations,” Baird said. Anatolians who picked up farming survived to pass their genes on to later Neolithic populations in central and western Anatolia. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8147-191030-spain-neanderthal-cave-art,Pre-Human,"Dating Questions Spark Neanderthal Cave Art Debate. NEW YORK, NEW YORK—The latest round in an ongoing debate over the age and authorship of ancient cave paintings in Spain now revolves around the reliability of a dating technique called U-Th, according to a report in Science News . U-Th, sometimes known as the U-series method, allows researchers to establish the minimum age of cave paintings by dating mineral deposits that have formed on top of them. These deposits contain trace amounts of uranium, which decays to thorium at a steady rate, so the age of the designs can be calculated from the ratio of the two elements. In 2018, a team led by geochronologist Dirk Hoffmann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, published a minimum date of more than 64,000 years ago for cave paintings at three separate sites in Spain, arguing that, as modern humans are not believed to have entered the region until about 40,000 years ago, the designs must have been made by Neanderthals. The assertion immediately made waves among scholars of cave art. Criticisms leveled at the paper have included questions over the cognitive capacity of Neanderthals to have produced the artwork, and, now, concerns that water running across cave surfaces could have reduced uranium levels in the mineral deposits, making it appear that the uranium had been decaying longer than it actually has. This would mean the Spanish cave art could be tens of thousands of years more recent, and well within the timeframe of modern humans. "

FINS, OMAN—A team of paleoclimatolgists led by Hokkaido University ’s Takaaki Watanabe has found new evidence for an increase in the dramatic seasonal dust storms known as shamals that may have contributed to the collapse of the Akkadian Empire around 4,200 years ago. Archaeologists have long known that famine and a breakdown in the social order played a significant role in the decline of Mesopotamia's first large-scale, united empire after 2200 B.C. Now Watanabe and his colleagues have analyzed fossil coral unearthed near the coast of northeastern Oman that lived between 4,500 and 2,900 years ago and show evidence for prolonged winter shamal seasons around 4,200 years ago. Frequent and intense dust storms could explain why Akkadian crop production dramatically decreased and the empire's irrigated fields underwent salinization, leading to widespread famine that triggered the state's dissolution.

CONWY, WALES—According to a BBC News report, the Great Orme mine in northern Wales was Britain's primary producer of copper during a mining boom that lasted from about 1600 to 1400 B.C. Geoarchaeologist Alan Williams of the University of Liverpool and University of Rennes archaeometallurgy specialist Cécile Le Carlier de Veslud analyzed copper ore from the mine, which scholars had previously thought was only a limited operation during the Bronze Age, and found that the metal was used to make bronze weapons and tools that have been discovered across Britain as well as in France, Germany, and Sweden. During the 200-year spike in activity at Great Orme, Williams estimates that miners produced several hundred tons of copper, an amount sufficient to make thousands of bronze objects each year. ""This very extensive distribution suggests a large-scale mining operation [in Bronze Age terms], with a full-time mining community,"" he said. "

TÜBINGEN, GERMANY— Cosmos Magazine reports that traces of Mediterranean wine have been found in vessels recovered in different areas of the Heuneberg site, which dates to around 500 to 700 B.C. and is located in southwest Germany. Maxime Rageot of the University of Tübingen tested 126 ceramic vessels used by different social classes that had been made locally, and detected chemicals produced by fermented grapes in them. Dairy and millet were also detected in the same vessels, she added. Because no evidence of grape seeds or wine production from the period has been found in central Europe, the wine is thought to have been imported. Fermented beverages made from other plants and honey may have been produced locally, however. Rageot and her colleagues also tested seven goblets, beakers, bowls, jugs, and bottles imported from Greece at the end of the period, and noted that by this time, wine drinking appeared to have been restricted to the elites. The researchers suggest the Celts may have eventually adopted Mediterranean-style feasting practices in addition to Mediterranean wine. "

SWANNANOA, NORTH CAROLINA—A team of researchers led by David Moore of Warren Wilson College has found a small piece of plate armor at Fort San Juan, a well-preserved fort built by Spanish soldiers some 450 years ago on the site of the Catawba town of Joara in what is now western North Carolina, according to a Blue Ridge Public Radio report. Moore said the soldiers took over the town and forced the Catawba to build homes and cook meals for them. “So this relationship of two groups understanding each other very poorly, trying to figure out what to do with the other was constantly in the air,” he explained. The small piece of plate armor, which would have been sewn into a garment, had been placed vertically in the soil next to a post in a Spanish soldier’s house. Moore thinks it may have served as a talisman against black magic. “A Spanish soldier had placed this in the building to ward off witches, especially because Indian women were feeding them,” he said. Excavators also found other artifacts from Joara and the fort, including a Spanish clothing hook fastener and a Native American clay pipe. "

GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS—According to a BBC News report, researchers including Marcel Niekus of Stichting STONE/Foundation for Stone Age Research suggest that Neanderthals were capable of complex thinking, based upon adhesive made from birch tar discovered on a Neanderthal stone tool. The well-preserved tool was discovered in Doggerland, in what would have been an icy tundra with few trees in an area now covered by the waters of the North Sea. Such adhesive requires more than 80 pounds of wood to produce, Niekus said. “They also had to invest time and energy in building the fire and extracting the tar,” he explained. Birch tar is usually thought to have been used to attach wooden handles to stone tools. The tar on this small tool, however, may have been used to improve the user’s grip and help prevent cuts to the user’s hands while cutting plant fibers or scraping animal skins. “With the investment in time needed, you would expect them only to do it with special hunting weapons,” Niekus said, “but they did it with special domestic tools as well. We think the use of birch tar was quite widespread.” "

JERUSALEM, ISRAEL— Deutsche Welle reports that traces of a well-preserved 1,500-year-old Christian church were uncovered during a construction project to the west of Jerusalem by a team of archaeologists led by Benjamin Storchan of the Israel Antiquities Authority. Storchan said the mosaic floors in the structure depict fruit, plants, and birds, including an eagle, a symbol of the Byzantine Empire. The church’s marble chancel and a baptismal font made of calcite flowstone were also found. An inscription in the courtyard dedicated the building to an unidentified “glorious martyr” thought to have been buried in an intact crypt under the church. Storchan said the opulence of the church suggests the martyr was an important figure in Christianity. Another inscription indicates that Emperor Tiberius II Constantinus contributed to the completion of the building. Pilgrims are thought to have visited the site until its entrances were sealed with heavy stones and it was abandoned in the ninth century A.D., during the Muslim Abbasid caliphate. "

NAPLES, ITALY—According to a Reuters report, Herculaneum’s House of the Bicentenary, a lavish three-story property boasting more than 6,000 square feet of living space, has reopened following extensive conservation. Gaius Petronius Stephanus and his wife Calantonia Themis lived in the House of the Bicentenary, which is located on the main street of the ancient Roman town buried by about 50 feet of volcanic ash during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Herculaneum was smaller than Pompeii, which is located about ten miles to the south, but is thought to have been inhabited by wealthier Romans. Archaeologist Domenico Camardo of the Herculaneum Conservation Project said a sliding wooden grill, placed at the entrance to the building, survived the disaster. The house, discovered in 1938 and named after the 200th anniversary of the first excavations in the ancient city, was closed to the public in 1983 for restoration and repair, including the removal of a coating that had been applied to its frescoes which had caused the paint to flake. “It was an occasion to develop new, innovative materials and methods for conservation that can be used in the site and elsewhere,” the Getty Conservation Institute's Leslie Rainer explained.

ECATEPEC, MEXICO— Mexico News Daily reports that archaeologists from Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History have discovered 11 images built into the walls of a 27-foot-long tunnel dating to the seventeenth century. The tunnel is part of a 2.5-mile-long network of dikes first constructed in the fifteenth century by Moctezuma I to regulate the flow of water into Mexico City, which was built on an island in the center of an inland lake system. The dike was destroyed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, and later rebuilt to control flooding. Archaeologist Raúl García said the images in the tunnel include a war shield, the head of a bird of prey, and a paper ornament. A picture of a temple, or teocalli , dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc, was etched into the central stone in the arch at the entrance to the tunnel. García suggests the petroglyphs and stucco relief panels could have been carved by people who lived in the nearby towns of Ecatepec and Chiconautla before the arrival of the Spanish and were later incorporated into the tunnel by people from the towns who worked on the rebuild. Four iron nails, two wooden beams, and a pile of organic material found in the tunnel may have been part of a gate to the seventeenth-century dike, García added. "

Brick structures, tubs, and an open water channel were uncovered near the pipelines and may have been connected to them. R. Sivanandam of the Archaeological Survey of India said the ten sections of the upper pipeline were firmly fitted together, and may have carried protected water in the settlement, which was inhabited by the people of the Tamil culture between the fifth century B.C. and the third century A.D. Rims on the pipes gave this pipeline a spiral shape, he added. The lower pipeline, made up of three long, barrel-shaped terracotta tubes, is thought to have served a different purpose than the upper pipeline. Its mouth had been fitted with a dish-shaped perforated lid that may have filtered water or other liquid. “Apart from this, it could also be surmised that the lid could have been used to prevent reptiles entering the premises through the pipes,” Sivanandam explained.

Some 2,700 years ago, astronomers in Babylon and Nineveh documented an unusual red glow in the sky on three separate cuneiform tablets, he explained. Mitsuma and his colleagues suggest this phenomenon may have been what are now known as stable auroral red arcs, which consist of light emitted by electrons in atmospheric oxygen atoms excited by intense magnetic fields. Tree ring data also registered a rapid rise in radioactive carbon-14 in the environment, which is associated with increased solar activity, at this time. Mitsuma said the information pushes the history of known solar activity back a century, and could help scientists predict future magnetic storms. "

SIEM REAP, CAMBODIA—Archaeologists have definitively identified the ruins of an ancient city in the mountains of northwestern Cambodia as Mahendraparvata, a short-lived capital of the early Khmer Empire from the late eighth to early ninth centuries A.D., Live Science reports. Inscriptions had placed the Phnom Klen plateau as the site of the city, which predates nearby Angkor by centuries. Using airborne laser scanning, Damian Evans of the École Française d’Extrême-Orient and his colleagues mapped the city and found that it was arranged in an extensive grid pattern, the earliest example of such urban planning in the area. Through on-the-ground survey, the team also identified more than 600 archaeological features, including temple sites marked by sandstone and brick pedestals and an extensive water management system that was never completed.  A massive reservoir, carved out of the natural bedrock, does not appear to have been connected to an irrigation system. Evans said that this lack of infrastructure—a necessity for agriculture—could explain why the city was left incomplete. “Now, having a very complete picture of the whole, greater Angkor area and a finalized map of the whole thing, we can start to do some pretty sophisticated modeling of things like population and growth over time,” he added.

It was previously thought that modern humans were the first hominins to land on the island about 7,000 years ago. The researchers suggest, however, that Neanderthals and other human relatives may have been able to walk to the Aegean basin, and access its raw materials and fresh water, during the Ice Age, when sea levels were lower.

Vessels produced for funerary use were not as carefully formed and fired as those produced for everyday use, Pasterkiewicz explained. Each of the stone-lined graves in the cemetery held between two and six people, and were covered with stone slabs or wooden beams if the pit was very large. The burials were eventually reopened and parts of the skeletons were removed, he added. Animals and animal parts were also buried in rectangular, stone-lined pits. “Cow and pig skeletons are most common,” Pasterkiewicz said. “Such graves are often referred to as ‘sacrificial pits’ because they contain the remains of animal[s] dedicated to the deceased.” Geophysical surveys indicate that about two-thirds of the cemetery has been investigated to date.

The warrior’s kit included a bronze awl with a birch handle, a knife, a chisel, a decorated belt box, three dress pins, arrowheads, and fragments of bronze that may have been used as currency. Three thin bronze metal cylinders pierced with bronze nails found with the kit may have been fittings for a cloth bag or wooden storage box. More than 12,000 pieces of human bone, belonging to more than 140 individuals, have been recovered from the ancient battlefield. Almost all of the bones belonged to young men and showed signs of recent and past trauma. Chemical analysis of the bones indicates that not all of the men grew up locally, and the researchers note that the bronze items in the warrior’s kit are similar to those found in southern Germany and the Czech Republic.

Pelletier said the bones, which were found in a 70,000-year-old layer of the rock shelter containing Mousterian stone tools, represent at least 225 individual animals. It had been previously thought that Neanderthals mainly hunted large, slow-moving animals, and only sporadically caught small game, but these bones bear cut marks from Mousterian tools and show signs of roasting. Most of the long limb bones had been snapped in two to remove the marrow, ruling out the possibility that the animals had been carried to the shelter by other predators. “It’s impossible for predators to make this type of breakage,” Pelletier explained. He also noted that the bones of rabbit paws and tails were missing from the collection, hinting that the pelts may have been removed from the animals with feet and tail intact. “We cannot imagine the Neanderthals just consumed the meat and didn’t exploit the fur after,” he added.

NAPLES, ITALY—A fresco that graphically depicts the impending combat victory of one gladiator over another has been uncovered in Pompeii's Regio V, according to a report in The Independent . The victor, identified as a murmillo-type gladiator by his weapons and armor, stands over a cowering foe equipped in the Thracian manner. The latter has sustained deep gashes to the wrist, legs, and chest, and is holding up a finger to beg for mercy. The fresco, which measures roughly four feet by five feet, was found in what appears to have been a basement tavern or store. The floor above may have housed the proprietors or been used as a brothel. Massimo Osanna, superintendent for Pompeii, says it is very likely the establishment was frequented by gladiators, whose barracks were not far from the site. "

HELSINKI, FINLAND— National Parks Traveler reports that the National Museum of Finland will hand over the remains of 20 individuals and 28 artifacts removed from what is now Mesa Verde National Park in the late nineteenth century to representatives of the 26 federally recognized Native American tribes traditionally associated with the park. In 1891, Gustaf Nordenskiöld, a young Swedish man, stopped in southwestern Colorado while on a world tour to study the cliff dwellings. He made sketches, took photographs, excavated 20 graves, and collected some 600 objects, including bowls, ladles, baskets, pots, mugs, corn cobs, woven sandals, mats, snowshoes, pouches, tools, arrows, and metates. He was arrested for theft, but eventually released and allowed to leave the country with the human remains and the objects. “The collection of artifacts and human remains by Gustaf Nordenskiöld and others played an important role in the signing of the 1906 Antiquities Act, protecting cultural resources, and the establishment of Mesa Verde National Park,” said park information officer Cristy Brown. Park officials will work with the repatriating tribes to return and rebury the remains and artifacts. “The repatriating tribes are the leaders of this effort,” Brown explained, “but we are proud to be able to fulfill our role when the time comes.” "

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8102-191011-bronze-age-society,Bronze Age,"Study Examines Bronze Age Status and Family Relationships. BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a Science Magazine report, analysis of the bones of 104 Early Bronze Age farmers who were buried in family cemeteries in southern Germany some 4,000 years ago has revealed a network of family groups related through the male line. Each household was made up of a high-status man married to a high-status women who grew up elsewhere, and unrelated male and female servants who had been buried without grave goods. Research team members Alissa Mittnik of Harvard Medical School and Philipp Stockhammer of Ludwig Maximilian University and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History explained that some of the high-ranking male individuals in the sample carried a variant of the Y chromosome, which is passed from fathers to sons, associated with the Neolithic Bell Beaker culture. The Y chromosome variant carried by these men is still found in Europe today. Men buried without grave goods in the family cemeteries carried a different variant of the Y chromosome. Women who had been buried with elaborate grave goods carried DNA unrelated to others buried in the cemetery. The chemical composition of their teeth and the style of some of their grave goods suggest they grew up in eastern Germany and the Czech Republic. The remains of local girls who had died before reaching adulthood, and poor unrelated women, were also identified in the cemeteries. The lack of remains of adult daughters of the wealthy suggests they moved away and married into other communities. "

DENBIGHSHIRE, WALES— BBC News reports that a Neolithic quarry has been discovered in northern Wales at St. Dyfnog’s Well, a Christian pilgrimage site connected to a sixth-century Welsh saint, who is said to have stood under a cold waterfall in a shirt belted with an iron chain as penance. The first written record of a church associated with the well, which is now a rectangular stone-lined pool fed by several springs, dates to the thirteenth century. Pilgrims to the well are said to have believed its water acquired healing powers from St. Dyfnog’s holiness. Archaeologist Ian Brooks explained that some 6,000 years ago, people came to the site to extract chert from local limestone by lighting fires to heat the rock, then pouring water on it to cause it to splinter. Brooks and a team of volunteers also uncovered steps leading down to the well basin, traces of a building, and a Victorian-era gin bottle. The well is thought to have been lined with marble in the eighteenth century, decorated with statues, and equipped with changing rooms for pilgrims. "

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL— The New York Times reports that hominins living in what is now Israel may have stored food as early as 400,000 years ago. Researchers led by Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv University analyzed marks on more than 80,000 bones from Qesem Cave and found heavy chop marks on the ends of some of fallow deer leg bones. Barkai said these bones carry no meat and little fat, and the skin is easy to remove when the bone is fresh. “We had a hypothesis that these unusual chop marks at the end of the meatless bones had to do with the removal of dry skin,” he said. To see if it was possible to store the bones in order to eat their nutritious marrow later, Barkai and his team members collected the leg bones of freshly killed deer and stored them in cave-like conditions for several weeks. At the end of each week, someone took a flint flake and a quartzite tool and attempted to break open a bone to remove its marrow, which was tested for its nutritional value. The experiments produced marks similar to those found on the Paleolithic deer bones, and the test results showed that after nine weeks, the bone marrow was still edible and nutritious. "

PLOVDIV, BULGARIA— The Sofia Globe reports that a marble slab bearing an inscription dating to the second century A.D. has been unearthed at the forum of the ancient city of Philippopolis in southern Bulgaria. The city’s library, treasury, and Odeon once stood in the area where the inscription was found. Epigrapher Nicolay Sharankov said the text is thought to be the end of a letter imposing a fine on the city by Emperor Septimius Severus for supporting Pescennius Niger, his rival to the throne. It also preserves the names of Philippus and Caecilius Cerealis, two ambassadors sent by the city to the emperor. Septimius Severus seized power in A.D. 193, a period of civil war known as the Year of the Five Emperors. Pescennius Niger was eventually defeated in A.D. 194 at the Battle of Issus in Cilicia, a Roman province in what is now southeastern Turkey. Septimius Severus expected a prominent citizen of Philippopolis to pay the fine, Sharankov added. "

HARISH, ISRAEL—As many as 6,000 people may have once lived in En Esur, a 5,000-year-old site uncovered in northern Israel, according to a CNN report. Built on top of an earlier settlement, the city was situated at the crossroads of two trade routes, covered more than 160 acres, and consisted of planned roads, alleys, designated residential neighborhoods and public areas, a temple, and fortifications. “Our site is more than two or three times larger than the largest sites [in this area] during this period,” explained archaeologist Yitzhak Paz of the Israel Antiquities Authority. A stone basin in the temple’s courtyard may have been used during religious rituals, while stone figurines depicting humans and animals, as well as burnt animal bones, were found inside the temple. Paz said his team of researchers does not know why the city was abandoned, but flooding along Israel’s coastal plain may have played a role. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8059-191008-greece-aegina-potters,Bronze Age,"Greek Pottery Used to Track Ancient Migration. ATHENS, GREECE—According to a Science in Poland report, archaeologist Bartłomiej Lis of the British School at Athens was able to track the movement of potters away from the island of Aegina some 3,200 years ago by analyzing pottery uncovered on the island and the areas surrounding the Gulf of Euboea. Lis said that potters working on the island of Aegina characteristically built the walls of their vessels without using a potter’s wheel, and marked their pots with an identifying sign, perhaps because they shared kilns. He also analyzed the chemical composition of the clay used to make the pottery through a technique known as petrography, which allowed him to determine where the clay had originated. Lis suggests that potters left Aegina in two stages over several decades, since pottery typical of that made on Aegina has been found in many places along the Gulf of Euboea, made from local materials. The potters may have left home for political and economic reasons, he explained. “Many of the previously flourishing settlements were deserted, and people apparently moved to safer areas,” Lis said. “In fact, the only trace of these movements are vessels made by potters who were part of these migrations.” "

Sechín Archaeological Project Director Mónica Suárez said that in addition to the animal’s bones, some of its yellow-brown fur and paw pads were preserved. Sechín, known for its megalithic architecture and bas relief sculptures depicting human sacrifices, is thought to have served as the capital city of the Sechín culture. Suárez explained that the dog belongs to a later occupation of the site by the Casma culture around A.D. 1000. Further analysis of the remains could reveal the dog’s breed and age at death, she added. "

SISSI, CRETE—An international team of archaeologists under the direction of Jan Driessen of the Belgian School at Athens , in collaboration with Greece’s Lasithi Antiquities Ephorate, has conducted excavations at a Minoan-era settlement in eastern Crete. This season, the team members uncovered a monumental building destroyed by fire around 2500 B.C. What was left of this structure was incorporated in about 1700 B.C. into a complex of monumental buildings, arranged around a central court measuring more than 100 feet long. The complex featured decorated plaster flooring and a terracotta drain. A box-shaped grave containing a woman’s intact skeleton dating to the post-Minoan era was uncovered near this building site. She had been buried with a copper mirror with an ivory handle, copper dress pins, and a necklace made up of 15 olive-shaped gold beads and smaller gold beads. The researchers said such graves are usually discovered at the Minoan sites of Archanes and Knossos, near Crete’s north-central coast, and the site of Chania further to the west. "

NAPLES, ITALY—According to a Science Magazine report, short-wave infrared hyperspectral imaging has allowed a team of researchers led by classicist Graziano Ranocchia of the National Research Council in Rome to decipher text written on the reverse side of a charred papyrus scroll that had been unrolled and glued down on paperboard sometime after it was recovered in the eighteenth century from the ruins of Herculaneum. Like Pompeii, Herculaneum was covered in ash during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. The scroll contains a work about Greece's great thinkers known as the History of the Academy, which was copied on the papyrus several decades before the eruption of the volcano by the philosopher Philodemus or one of his scribes. Ranocchia said that in all, the team members were able to add 150 words to the 8,000 known words of Philodemus’ manuscript, and to correct translations of some words that had been misread. The technique could help researchers take a fresh look at the nearly 2,000 papyri recovered from Herculaneum. "

The structure measured about 44 feet long and 18 feet wide, and was equipped with a gate, fence, and an outbuilding. This is the first large building from the Fujiwarakyo era to be found away from the center of the ancient capital. Hitoshi Hayashibe of the National Museum of Japanese History thinks that the luxurious home suggests the nobility of Fujiwarakyo were not required to live near the imperial palace, as was required by Empress Genmei, who completed the move of the imperial capital from Fujiwarakyo to Heijokyo in A.D. 710. Tsuyoshi Ozawa of Mie University, however, thinks the gate at the site indicates the structure was used as a government office. "

Nabataean culture is usually associated with the capital city of Petra in Jordan, but the site of the ancient Nabataean city of Hegra, which was founded in the first century A.D., is located in this region of Saudi Arabia. “Exactly how our findings will impact on understanding of ancient history, we don’t yet know,” Foote said. “But it is likely to reshape the world view of earlier periods.” Jamie Quartermaine of Oxford Archaeology said that the thousands of high-resolution photographs taken during aerial surveys of the region and assembled with specialty software will allow the team members to map funerary architecture, standing stones, and rock art sites. The team members will also examine how the Nabataeans managed water and agriculture. In the project’s final stage, researchers will venture into the field on foot. "

Rain forest environments pose special challenges to survival, including disease, dangerous animals, and limited food sources, and so it had been previously thought that migrating humans avoided such difficult settings. The microliths, which measure about an inch and a half long, are thought to have been used as projectiles by Sri Lanka’s first inhabitants to hunt tree-dwelling creatures and small mammals. Similar sophisticated tools continued to be used by local rain forest cultures as recently as 4,000 years ago. "

NAPLES, ITALY— Live Science reports that an inscription discovered at a tomb in Pompeii in 2017 has been translated by Massimo Osanna, director general of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii. The text describes the tomb occupant’s coming-of-age party as a young man, which featured a banquet for 6,840 people and a gladiator show with more than 400 fighters. Osanna said the guests would have only been adult men who possessed political rights, or about 27 to 30 percent of the population, putting the city’s total at about 30,000 people around A.D. 59. The inscription also relates how the man sold wheat at discounted prices to Pompeii citizens and distributed free bread during a four-year famine. Osanna thinks this gesture may have been depicted in a now famous Pompeii mosaic showing bread distribution to two men and a child. This citizen was also remembered for successfully speaking to Emperor Nero on behalf of Pompeians who were ejected from the city after a riot during a gladiator show. Based upon the contents of other inscriptions in the city, Osanna thinks the tomb’s occupant may have been Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius, but the area where a name had been carved in the tomb was destroyed by looters in the nineteenth century.

TAUNTON, ENGLAND—According to a BBC News report, radiocarbon dating has revealed that some of the human remains found in two boxes stored at the Somerset Heritage Centre are more than 9,000 years old. Osteoarchaeologist Sharon Clough of Cotswold Archaeology said the bones were first discovered in a cave near a Roman cemetery in southwest England in the 1960s, and at the time, had been thought to date to the Roman era as well. “But they’d been picked out of the rubble in the cave and weren’t seen as part of the main dig so they were only mildly interesting and were archived and forgotten about,” Clough reasoned. The bones, which include thigh bones, cranial pieces, and pelvis fragments, belonged to at least seven different people, she added, and are remains of some of the oldest-known people to have lived in what is now England. The cave where the bones were discovered was destroyed by quarrying in the 1990s. "

ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA—A new study has carefully analyzed soil from different levels of Siberia’s Denisova Cave for microscopic traces of coprolites, bone, charcoal, ash, and stone flakes over a period of 300,000 years, Cosmos reports. Denisovans are thought to have first occupied the cave some 287,000 years ago, while Neanderthals are thought to have arrived 140,000 years ago. However, the test results suggest hominins only visited the cave sporadically, if at all. Archaeologist Mike Morley of Flinders University said the amount of fossilized hyena and wolf droppings in the cave suggest non-human carnivores were the cave’s primary inhabitants. In addition, the limited evidence for the use of fire in the cave could mean that hominin bones might have been carried into the cave by scavenging hyenas. The study also revealed that the climate in the region changed from a cold and arid open steppe during glacial periods to warmer, wetter forested steppe during interglacial periods. Morley said Neanderthals and Denisovans were probably both well adapted to living in cold weather. "

WARSAW, POLAND—Researchers led by Piotr Dyczek of the University of Warsaw uncovered a fragment of an engraved bronze plate in a centurion’s home at a Roman fortress on the Danube River in what is now northern Bulgaria, according to a Science in Poland report. Beginning in the third century A.D., Rome recruited regional allies to defend its expanding borders with the promise of citizenship to those who enlisted and served for a minimum of 25 years. This engraved fragment was part of one of two bronze plates fastened together with a chain that made up the official document awarding citizenship to a veteran at the end of those 25 years. “Interestingly, not everyone could look inside the document, not even its owner, because each time after checking its content, officials would seal the chains,” Dyczek said, in order to prevent forgeries. Proof of citizenship would have allowed a veteran to hold public office, make money, and advance socially, Dyczek explained. Researchers hope to learn the veteran’s name and details of his life once the plate fragment has been cleaned. "

The jar was shaped like the head of a wrestler or boxer with a broken nose and goatee. Its presence in the grave, along with a type of blade used to scrape sweat and dirt from the skin, suggests the 35- to 40-year-old man buried in the grave was a sports enthusiast. The figure on the jar also appears to be wearing a cap made from the skin of a panther or leopard—a possible allusion to the Roman myth in which the hero and god Hercules defeated with his bare hands a lion that attacked the city of Nemea.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8035-190927-neanderthal-ear-infections,Pre-Human,"Common Childhood Illness May Have Persisted in Neanderthals. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK—Researchers from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University suggest that the structure of Neanderthals’ ears could have contributed to their extinction. Eustachian tubes are cartilaginous structures connecting the middle ear to the upper throat and the back of the nasal cavity. The team of physical anthropologists and head and neck anatomists found that Neanderthal Eustachian tubes had a flat angle resembling the Eustachian tubes of modern human infants. Middle ear infections are common among young children today because this flat angle is prone to trapping bacteria in the tube. But by the age of five, the tubes lengthen and the angle becomes more acute, allowing the ear to drain. It appears, however, that the lifelong flat angle of Neanderthal Eustachian tubes left the hominins susceptible to ear infections and complications such as respiratory infections, hearing loss, pneumonia, and chronic health problems that could have made it difficult to compete for survival.

The Tripolye culture, also known as the Cucuteni-Tripyllia culture, occupied the area from the Carpathian Mountains to the Dnieper River from about 4100 to 3600 B.C. The rectangular building, made of clay-covered split wood and logs, had a roofed-off section with a fireplace, a walled courtyard, and was one of 3,000 individual homes arranged in concentric rings at Maidanetske, although the researchers, led by Robert Hofmann of Christian-Albrechts University, are not sure how many of the structures existed at the same time. Other prehistoric megastructures measuring up to 18,000 square feet have been found in Eastern Europe through geophysical surveys, but without excavation, researchers did not know how such structures were used.

Biomolecular archaeologist Julie Dunne of the University of Bristol said other similar vessels, found in locations around the world and dating back some 7,000 years, could have also been used to feed infants. While the vessels in the study were utilitarian in form, some of these other objects were decorated with playful ears, horns, human feet, and interesting shapes, or crafted in the forms of imaginary animals. The ability to feed young children animal milk may have allowed members of the community to share in mothering duties, added Katharina Rebay-Salisbury of the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, perhaps boosting the chance of survival at a time when about one-third of all babies in Europe are thought to have died before their first birthdays.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8029-190925-peru-inca-construction,Pre-Columbian,"Why Did the Inca Build Cities in Peru’s Fault Zones?. PHOENIX, ARIZONA—According to a Science Magazine report, geologist Rualdo Menegat of Brazil’s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul suggests that Machu Picchu and several other cities were designed by the Inca to reflect the geologic fractures and faults intersecting underneath them. Using satellite imagery and field measurements, Menegat and his team mapped the fractures and faults beneath Machu Picchu, and found that they occur in sets, which intersect under the sanctuary city. The city’s different sectors and agricultural fields, and even individual buildings and staircases, are oriented along these major fault lines. ""Machu Picchu’s location is not a coincidence,"" Menegat said. ""It would be impossible to build such a site in the high mountains if the substrate was not fractured."" This fractured substrate, he argues, offered the Inca the advantages of abundant building stone, channels to transport meltwater and rainwater to the site, and drainage to carry away water during intense rainstorms. The layouts of Ollantaytambo, Pisac, and Cusco also reflect intersecting fault lines in the earth, he added. "

SAAREMAA, ESTONIA—Metal detectorist Jegor Klimov discovered a 1,700-year-old gold bracelet, several crossbow brooches made of silver and gold-plated silver, and belt plaques decorated with silver at a sacrificial site on the island of Saaremaa in the Baltic Sea, according to an Estonian Public Broadcasting report. Archaeologist Marika Mägi said that although the finely detailed, massive gold bracelet is unique in Estonia, such jewelry is found throughout Scandinavia, where it is associated with Iron Age royalty. “How this particular bracelet ended up in Saaremaa is an exciting question in its own right, and one we’ll likely never get a real answer for,” she said. The bracelet will be housed at the Saaremaa Museum. "

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL—According to a Haaretz report, cut marks on a Paleolithic swan bone found in Qesem Cave suggest that hominins left the marks when they removed feathers from its wings sometime between 420,000 and 200,000 years ago. The research team, led by Ruth Blasco of Spain’s National Research Center on Human Evolution (CENIEH) and Avi Gopher and Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv University, noted that the bone, known as the carpometacarpal, is effectively meatless. “We have no idea where the swan’s other bones got to,” Barkai explained. “But the special aspect is that there was nothing to eat on that bone. The only thing they could do with it is remove its feathers.” Other bones from the animal have not been recovered from the cave. The rest of the bird might have been butchered and eaten outside of the cave, so the wing feathers taken into the cave might have served a ritual purpose, Barkai added. "

CUZCO, PERU—According to a Science in Poland report, a team led by Dagmara Socha of the Center for Andean Studies of the University of Warsaw in Cuzco and Rudy Perea Chávez of the Catholic University of Santa Maria in Arequipa's Museo Santuarios Andinos is reexamining the remains of six sacrificed children discovered decades ago on top of the Ampato and Pichu Pichu volcanoes. “The Incas considered the children pure and untouched; their status was supposed to facilitate persuading the gods to make specific decisions,” Socha explained. Radiography of the mummified remains reveals the Inca buried the children with wooden ritual cups, gold pins and tubes, and petals. Socha thinks the children may have been chosen for sacrifice from different regions of the Inca Empire some 500 years ago because they were particularly beautiful, or had a particular ancestry. The remains of a girl found on a platform on Pichu Pichu, for example, had an intentionally elongated head—a lowland practice not known to be in use in the mountains where the girl’s body was recovered. Marks in her tooth enamel indicate she suffered nutritional distress that disrupted her development at about three years of age. Socha suggests the girl was taken away from her parents at this time and brought to Cuzco, where she was prepared for sacrifice at the top of the volcano at the age of six. The team members plan to analyze the chemical composition of the children’s tooth enamel for information on their diets and places of birth. "

Analyses of samples from the site indicate it was occupied as early as the sixth century B.C., or about 300 years earlier than previously thought. In addition to readjusting the timeline of the Sangam Era, the test results push back the age of the Tamil-Brahmi script and the advent of literacy in the region to the sixth century B.C., explained T. Udayachandran, the state commissioner of archaeology. More than 50 pieces of pottery bearing Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions were recovered at the site during recent excavations. Spindle whorls, bone-tip tools, terracotta spheres, a copper needle, and vessels for holding liquid—all tools thought to have been used to manufacture textiles—were also recovered. "

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a BBC News report, Natalie Laudicina of Boston University and her colleagues examined six female fossil pelvises, which represent individuals who lived over a span of more than three million years, and found that each species probably faced its own challenges while giving birth. It had been previously thought that childbirth became more difficult over the course of evolution as hominins transitioned to upright walking. Today, a modern human fetus often requires assistance to rotate its large head through a narrow birth canal over a long period of labor, while chimpanzees and other non-human primates are able to deliver their infants alone and over a period of several hours. “There is a tendency to think about the evolution of human birth as a transition from an ‘easy,’ ape-like birth to a ‘difficult,’ modern birth,” Laudicina explained. She and her team found, however, that some three million years ago, Australopithecus afarensis females probably experienced a more difficult birthing process than Australopithecus sediba females, who lived about one million years later.

HAIFA, ISRAEL—According to a Live Science report, a well-preserved mosaic floor dating to the late fifth or early sixth century A.D. has been uncovered at the site of a church in the ancient city of Hippos, which is located in northern Israel on a mountain overlooking the Sea of Galilee. Michael Eisenberg of the University of Haifa said images of loaves of bread, fish, fruit, birds, and baskets in the mosaic could refer to two miracles described in the Christian New Testament, in which Jesus multiplied a few loaves and fishes to feed thousands of people, and his disciples collected leftovers. Although the purported location of the miracles is unclear, he added, the church may have been built in Hippos to mark the site where the miracles were believed to have occurred. Greek inscriptions in the mosaic indicate the structure was built by the church fathers for a martyr named “Theodoros.” The church was burned to the ground in the beginning of the seventh century during the Sasanian conquest.

JERUSALEM, ISRAEL— The Guardian reports that researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have produced a portrait of a young Denisovan woman based upon analysis of DNA extracted from her fossilized finger bone. Liran Carmel, David Gokhman, and their colleagues examined “methylation maps” for Denisovan, Neanderthal, and modern human genomes to track how actively different genes were expressed in their anatomies. Once the researchers had compiled a list of genes that were likely to have been active in this Denisovan genome, they compared the list to a medical database of human genetic disorders to look for clues as to how gene activity might affect skeletal structure and thus, the young woman’s appearance. In all, the researchers identified 56 areas of anatomy in which Denisovans differed from Neanderthals and modern humans. Denisovan skulls were probably wider than Neanderthal and modern human skulls, with longer jaws, which would have allowed for larger teeth, like the three recovered from Siberia’s Denisova Cave. Gokhman said that understanding what Denisovans looked like could help scientists understand how they adapted to their environment, and how those adaptations may have been passed on to people living today.

ANDREWS, SCOTLAND— Earth.com reports that researchers led by Kirsty Graham of the University of St. Andrews have determined that as many as 90 percent of 70 identified communicative gestures used by wild bonobos and chimpanzees are shared by the two species, a rate much higher than would be expected to occur by chance. Such gestures include stroking the mouth to request food and raising arms to request grooming, Graham explained. The researchers asked human experiment participants to watch video clips of ten signs commonly used by chimpanzees and bonobos, and asked them to choose a correct meaning for each sign from four options. Some gestures, such as stroking of the mouth to request food, were identified correctly by the study participants more than 80 percent of the time. They correctly identified other signals about 52 percent of the time, Graham said. An earlier study conducted by University of St. Andrews psychologists identified gestures used by great apes in human children between the ages of one and two, and found that almost 90 percent of the 52 gestures used by the human children were shared with chimpanzees. Graham and her colleagues suggest today’s great apes and modern humans may have inherited a basic sign language from their last common ancestor. "

MANNHEIM, GERMANY—According to a report in The Times of Israel , an international team of scientists led by Daniel Berger of the Curt Engelhorn Center for Archaeometry and his retired colleague Ernst Pernicka analyzed the composition of tin ingots recovered from five Late Bronze Age underwater archaeological sites in the eastern Mediterranean in order to trace their origins. It had been previously thought that the tin used in bronze production in the Levant in the second millennium B.C. was imported from central Asia, since very little raw tin exists in the region. Comparison of the composition of the various samples revealed, however, that tin ingots found at three sites off the coast of Haifa, Israel, are likely to have been mined in southwest England, in what are now the areas of Cornwall and Devon. Tin from mines in Anatolia, central Asia, and Egypt was ruled out as a source for these samples because it was formed either much earlier or later. The researchers suggest that amber, glass, and copper were probably also traded along complex routes connecting Europe and the eastern Mediterranean much earlier than had been believed. "

SUVOROVO, BULGARIA— Archaeology in Bulgaria reports that a six-inch-long fragment of a ceramic figurine depicting a woman’s torso has been unearthed at the site of a workshop in northeastern Bulgaria, near the coast of the Black Sea. The complete statue is thought to have stood about a foot tall when it was crafted sometime in the brief Middle Chalcolithic period, between 4700 and 4600 B.C. Vladimir Slavchev of the Varna Museum of Archaeology said few anthropomorphic figures dating to this period have been found in the region. A piece of the figurine that had been attached to its belly area had broken off, which suggests to Slavchev and his colleagues that the sculpture may have been intended to depict a pregnant woman. “It is very richly decorated with stamped lines on the front and on the back,” Slavchev said. “Various geometrical motifs were encrusted, which most probably convey the decoration of the clothing.” The figurine may have represented a priestess or Mother Goddess, he added.

BINGHAMTON, NEW YORK—According to a Science News report, hunter-gatherers living in North America some 4,000 years ago may have had direct trade links spanning 900 miles. A ceremonial copper object has been found surrounded by a ring of seashells at an ancient grave site on St. Catherines Island off the coast of Georgia. Known as the McQueen shell ring, the circle of shells measures nearly 230 feet across. At its center, anthropologist Matthew Sanger of Binghamton University and his colleagues unearthed a pit containing the copper band, bits of stone tools, and tens of thousands of ash-encrusted bone and tooth fragments representing at least seven individuals. Such cremation burials are rare in the Southeast for this period, Sanger said. Chemical analysis of the copper band, which has been radiocarbon dated to between 4,300 and 3,800 years old, indicates it originated in copper mines at Lake Superior, in an area where cremation burials from this period are found more frequently. People living in the Southeast and Great Lakes regions may have gathered together at Georgia’s McQueen shell ring, Sanger explained, for seasonal ceremonies, where they feasted on fish, clams, oysters, hickory nuts, and acorns.

PARIS, FRANCE— The New York Times reports the creation of a virtual skull for the last common ancestor of living modern humans. A team of researchers led by paleoanthropologists Aurélien Mounier of the French National Museum of Natural History and Marta Mirazón Lahr of the University of Cambridge took CT scans of the skulls of 260 people living all over the world today, and also scanned the skulls of other extinct hominins, including 100,000-year-old skulls unearthed in Israel that are similar to those of living humans. The scientists then arranged the skulls on an evolutionary tree in order to predict what the skull of living humans’ common ancestor looked like some 300,000 years ago. They then compared the virtual skull with actual 300,000-year-old fossil skulls found in Morocco, Tanzania, South Africa, and Kenya. The differences between the virtual skull and the fossils indicate that there may have been three separate human populations in Africa, Mounier and Lahr suggest, and those from South Africa and Kenya may have merged to become the ancestors of today’s modern humans. The addition of more skulls could continue to alter the proposed virtual skull, Mounier said, adding, “There are a lot of things we can do, even without new fossils.” "

YORK, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that calcified plaque scraped from 6,000-year-old teeth has provided early evidence for dairy consumption among Britain’s Neolithic farmers. Traces of dairy products analyzed in the study were obtained from pottery fragments recovered at three Neolithic sites in Britain. Testing of these residues suggests that some of the milk had been heated, and analysis of the dental plaque using mass spectrometry detected a dairy protein in some of the individuals. The milk may have been converted into cheese, yogurt, or another fermented product that is easier to digest, since the DNA evidence indicates Britain’s Neolithic farmers were lactose intolerant. University of York archaeologist Sophy Charlton said people may have only consumed small amounts of dairy in order to avoid the abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea that can result from the inability to digest lactose beyond infancy. The mutation that makes it possible for adults to digest milk is thought to have first appeared in Europe during the Bronze Age. "

The 80,000-year-old footprints, found in five layers of sediment in a creek bed in northwestern France, are thought to have been left by Neanderthals, since they are the only hominins known to have lived in Europe at the time. The prints are also wider than those usually made by modern humans. About 80 percent of the prints, made by 10 to 13 individuals, were found in a single layer of sediment. The sizes of these prints indicate the group was made up of mostly children as young as two and adolescents. Some of the largest prints at the site are thought to have been made by an individual who stood about five feet seven inches tall, about seven inches taller than most Neanderthals. "

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a Live Science report, a new study of the chemical composition of the 2,000-year-old Temple Scroll revealed traces of a salty mineral solution that could account for its remarkable state of preservation. The Temple Scroll is one of nearly 1,000 Jewish religious manuscripts known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the first of which were discovered in caves on the shores of Israel’s Dead Sea in the 1940s. Researchers led by Admir Masic of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted several tests on a fragment of the scroll, including X-ray scans and Raman spectroscopy, a technique that determines a substance's chemical composition by analyzing how laser light scatters off chemical elements. The analysis detected salts made of sulfur, sodium, calcium, and other elements, but the salts did not match those found on the cave floor where the parchment was discovered, or those found in the Dead Sea. This suggests that they were purposefully applied as part of the parchment-making process, the researchers explained. None of the other Dead Sea Scrolls was finished in this way. "

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a Live Science report, Vagheesh Narasimhan of Harvard Medical School and his colleagues were able to obtain a viable DNA sample from the remains of one of 61 individuals buried some 5,000 years ago in a cemetery in northern India. This is the first time that scientists have been successful in extracting genetic material from a member of the ancient Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley, which covered parts of what are now Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northwestern India, because the region’s heat and humidity cause genetic material to degrade rapidly. Analysis of the genome suggests the ancient inhabitants of the Indus Valley are linked to modern South Asians, and that they developed farming independently, since the individual’s genes had diverged from those of other early farming cultures, Narasimhan explained. In a related study of more than 500 people who lived in South and Central Asia over the past 8,000 years, researchers identified 11 individuals unearthed at archaeological sites outside of the Indus Valley with genetic data closely linked to the Indus Valley individual. Narasimhan said it had been noted that their burials were unusual for their locations, and suggested that they may have been migrants who left the Indus Valley. “Population mixture and movement at very large scales is just a fundamental fact of human history,” Narasimhan said. More DNA samples are needed to shed light on these relationships, he added. "

The finger bone was discovered in southern Siberia’s Denisova Cave in 2008, but it was separated into two pieces in order to send them to different laboratories, in an effort to increase the chances of obtaining DNA samples. One of the fragments eventually went missing, while the other was ground up in the testing process. Geigl and her team matched the genomes obtained from samples of the two fragments to show that they came from the same individual, and then reunited photographs of them to produce an image of the whole bone. Geigl concluded that Denisovans had slim fingers that more closely resembled those of modern humans than Neanderthals, even though Denisovans are thought to have been more closely related to Neanderthals.

HUANCHACO, PERU— The Guardian reports that 227 skeletons of children ranging in age from five to 14 have been uncovered at a coastal desert site in northern Peru. “This is the biggest site where the remains of sacrificed children have been found,” said National University of Trujillo archaeologist Feren Castillo, part of an excavation team led by Gabriel Prieto of the University of Florida. The children are thought to have been sacrificed by the Chimú culture some 500 years ago, during a period when the El Niño weather pattern caused torrential rains and flooding. Muddy footprints suggest the children marched one mile from the adobe city of Chan Chan to the burial site, and lesions on their breastbones indicate they were killed with ceremonial knives before they were buried facing the sea. Some of the well-preserved remains still have skin and hair, and some of the children were wearing silver earrings at the time of death. "

CORVALLIS, OREGON—According to a Live Science report, researchers led by Loren Davis of Oregon State University have unearthed stone tools, the butchered remains of an extinct horse, and a hearth or fire pit at the Cooper’s Ferry site, which is situated at the junction of Rock Creek and the lower Salmon River in western Idaho. Charcoal and bone samples from the site's oldest layers associated with human artifacts have been radiocarbon dated to between 16,560 and 15,280 years ago. The evidence, Davis suggested, indicates that people were living in western Idaho some 1,000 years before melting ice created a corridor through what is now the western United States. He said this increases the chance that the first Americans traveled in boats from Beringia down the Pacific Coast, then made their way inland via waterways. "

LEIPZIG, GERMANY— Science Magazine reports that a nearly complete skull dating to 3.8 million years ago has been discovered in Ethiopia. Cleveland Museum of Natural History paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie says the skull belongs to the human ancestor Australopithecus anamensis , thought to have lived as early as 4.2 million years ago and known mainly by its jaws and teeth. Named MRD after Miro Dora, the site where it was found, this individual probably had a brain about the size of that of a chimpanzee, jutting cheekbones, elongated canine teeth, and oval-shaped earholes. It had been previously thought that Australopithecus anamensis , which was identified in 1995, gave rise to Australopithecus afarensis , made famous by the discovery of “Lucy” in 1974. The new discovery suggests, however, that the two species coexisted for a period of about 100,000 years. Australopithecus afarensis is also known for its bigger brain and flatter face, Haile-Selassie explained, calling into question the ancestry of later hominins who also had projecting cheekbones and oval-shaped earholes that resembled those of Australopithecus anamensis .

Excavations of the village, thought to have been inhabited for 1,000 years, are led by Stephen Dockrill of the University of Bradford. “The archaeology is extremely vulnerable to the changes in sea level due to climate change and what we are also seeing is the effect of every tide,” Dockrill said. “Every tide is acting like a vacuum and, as it goes out, it takes material away.” Dockrill said the village may have been surrounded by a ditch and centered around a roundhouse, currently under excavation, that would have been closer to the sea.

KARNATAKA, INDIA— The Times of India reports that a twelfth-century sculpture depicting Vishnu has been discovered at a temple site near India’s southwestern coast. In Hinduism, the god Vishnu preserves and protects the universe, and is often shown with blue skin and four arms. This sculpture is in the style popularly known as Vishnumurthy in Tulunadu and belongs to the region’s Bhagavatha sect. T. Murugeshi of MSRS College said the statue was found under 18 feet of debris, including architectural pieces and bricks, in a well near the remains of the razed temple. In this image, Vishnu is dressed with a headdress, earrings, armlets, and anklets. In his front right hand, he holds a pinda, or ball of cooked rice or barley offered to ancestors during funeral rites. A club representing mental and physical strength dangles from his left wrist, while his front left hand rests on his waist. The back left hand holds a conch shell, used to produce the primeval sound of creation. Murugeshi said the back right hand is missing but the excavation team members are looking for it.

SANTIAGO, CHILE—According to a Live Science report, Francisco Garrido and Catalina Morales of Chile’s National Museum of Natural History suggest the conquerors of the expanding Inca Empire may have displayed human heads at the remote village of Iglesia Colorada as part of an ideological effort to quell social unrest among resistant villagers. In 2003, the fragments of four skulls were discovered in a garbage dump at the site, which is located in the Atacama Desert. Three of the skulls are thought to have belonged to young women, and one to a child. The condition of the bones indicates that all of them had been malnourished. Each of the skulls showed signs of possible scrape marks around the jaws, perhaps to skin them, and holes drilled into the skulls may have been used to string them on rope, the researchers explained. “It doesn’t seem that the Incas targeted the leaders [of the village],” Garrido said, but this act may have been intended to demonstrate the power of the Inca Empire.

ATHENS, GREECE—New research by Alessandro Pierattini of the University of Notre Dame indicates that a “primitive lifting machine” was employed by Greek builders as early as the mid-seventh century B.C., according to a Gizmodo report. Previous researchers have suggested that the grooves found on stones in the temples at Corinth and Isthmia may have been the result of the quarrying process, but Pierattini thinks the Corinthians used grooves, combined with rope passed over a frame, to move heavy materials while constructing ships and buildings. They may have also used such a lifting machine to lower heavy sarcophagi into pits, he said. Pierattini attempted to move similarly grooved stone blocks with a simple lifting machine, and found that the grooves could have allowed ancient builders to lift blocks weighing between about 400 and 900 pounds, and position them with the assistance of metal levers. The machine would have been in use for about 150 years, he added, until the invention of the crane—which moves heavy objects using hoists and winches—some 2,500 years ago. "

TÜBINGEN, GERMANY—Paleoanthropologist Katerina Harvati of the University of Tübingen and her colleagues determined that damage to a 33,000-year-old skull was inflicted with a bat-like object by a possibly left-handed attacker who struck two consecutive blows while facing the victim, according to a report from Live Science . “The extent of the injuries that he sustained would have led to death,” Harvati said. The skull, discovered in a cave in Romania in 1941 by phosphate miners, belonged to an adult man known as the Cioclovina individual. For the study, Harvati and her colleagues took a CT scan of the skull, and then used synthetic models to try to re-create its injuries. The team members dropped the model skulls to simulate falls, hit them with rocks, and clubbed them with bats. The prehistoric wounds on the skull closely matched the modern wounds created with blunt-force trauma, Harvati explained. “Our results clearly showed that the fracture patterns observed on this skull could not have been produced after death, or from an accidental fall,” she said.

Kuraszkiewicz of the University of Warsaw uncovered dozens of poorly preserved 2,000-year-old mummies in the area of the so-called “Dry Moat,” which surrounds Saqqara’s Pyramid of Djoser. Kuraszkiewicz said the mummies had received basic embalming treatments and were placed in wooden coffins before they were buried in pits in the sand. Painted images that survived on one coffin, which was damaged in antiquity, show a multicolored necklace and an imitation of a hieroglyphic inscription. “Apparently, the artisan who painted it could not read,” Kuraszkiewicz said, “and perhaps he tried to re-create something that he had seen before. In any case, some of the painted shapes are not hieroglyphic signs, and the whole does not form a coherent text.” Two blue images of Anubis, an Egyptian god associated with mummification and the afterlife, adorn the feet of the coffin, he added. Anubis, however, is usually depicted in black. Kuraszkiewicz suggests the blue coloring of the painting may reference the ancient Egyptian belief that the hair of the divine jackal was made of precious blue stone. "

It was previously suggested that the footprints may have been made by Neanderthals some 250,000 years ago, and that the individuals had been fleeing a volcanic eruption. But Inan Ulusoy of Hacettepe University and Martin Danišík of Curtin University say the footprints were made by modern humans walking with staffs at normal speeds along with an unidentified species of wolf, coyote, or dog. The walkers may have approached the volcano for a closer look after its initial eruption, and may even have recorded the event, Ulusoy explained, with an illustration that is now known as the Kanlitaş rock painting, located about 1.2 miles away from the footprint site. The artwork shows a line that might represent lava flowing out of a crater-like circular shape. “Anyone can imagine that this is an event that one may face rarely in a lifetime,” Ulusoy said. “This may have given the inspiration to the Bronze Age people to leave the note behind.” "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7687-190530-jordan-khirbat-es-sar,Near East,"Ancient Temple Complex Investigated in Jordan. WARSAW, POLAND—According to a Science in Poland report, a team of archaeologists led by Jolanta Młynarczyk and Mariusz Burdajewicz of the University of Warsaw has begun to investigate the ancient temple complex known as Khirbat es-Sar, in northwestern Jordan. The earlier of two buildings at the site was constructed in the seventh century B.C., and may have been built to honor Belphegor, also known as Baal of Mount Phogor, who was worshipped in the region at the time. The second building dates to the first century A.D., when Belphegor was identified with the Greek god Zeus. The excavators also unearthed evidence that a Roman-era courtyard was enclosed sometime during the ninth or tenth century and used as a shop or residence into the fifteenth century. A lintel block in this room was decorated with an equal-arm cross set in a wreath, which may have been a Christian symbol. Human remains, buried without grave goods, were discovered under a courtyard arcade. “These are most likely burials of Bedouins from late-Ottoman times, from the nineteenth century,” Młynarczyk said. Future excavations will continue to search for the settlement’s ancient name. "

NOVOSIBIRSK, RUSSIA— The Siberian Times reports that the skulls of large birds and at least 30 beaks were found in a 5,000-year-old grave in a cemetery belonging to the Odinov Culture in western Siberia. The birds’ species have not been identified by ornithologists yet, but Lilia Kobeleva of the Novosibirsk Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography and her colleagues suspect they were cranes or herons. She said the bird remains were arranged around the deceased as if they had been worn as a collar, headdress, or armor. It is not clear, however, whether the beaks were attached to each other or to a piece of fabric. Two children, aged approximately five and 10, were buried near the so-called “Bird Man.” A man’s skeleton was found under the children’s remains, separated by a wooden overlay. Near his skull, excavators uncovered three bronze items bearing traces of organic material that may have made up a burial mask or a type of head gear. Five polished stone pendants thought to have been used in rituals were found beside him. “Both men must have carried special roles in the society,” Kobeleva said, adding that it is likely they were priests of some kind.

SOFIA, BULGARIA— Archaeology in Bulgaria reports that a dwelling dating to the Late Bronze Age was discovered in northwest Bulgaria during investigation of the proposed route of a natural gas pipeline stretching from Russia, through Turkey and Bulgaria, and into Central Europe. The structure had wattle-and-daub walls fashioned from vertical wooden poles woven with sticks and plastered with clay. “What’s interesting is that [one of] the clay walls collapsed right on top of the [household] inventory that was inside the dwelling, and we are finding [the artifacts] right where they stood over 3,000 years ago,” said archaeologist Andrey Aladzhov of Bulgaria’s National Institute and Museum of Archaeology. The artifacts include pottery made by the Orsoya-Baley Culture, he added, which links the site to settlements found near the Danube River and the Mediterranean Sea. Radiocarbon dating of bone fragments in a burial urn found near the home could help archaeologists date the site. "

CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA— Live Science reports that a new survey conducted in central Laos by a team of archaeologists from Laos and Australia revealed an additional 137 stone jars at 15 new sites in the rugged terrain surrounding the Plain of Jars. The giant, carved stone jars are thought to have been used in burial rituals some 2,500 years ago. Researchers have suggested that bodies may have been stored in the jars until the bones could be cleaned and buried. Archaeologist Louise Shewan of Monash University said the newly mapped jars indicate that such burial practices may have been more widespread than previously thought. The jars were probably carved in quarries and transported to the forested mountain sites, said Shewan's codirector on the project, Dougald O’Reilly of Australian National University. Near the jars, the researchers uncovered stone disks carved with images of animals and geometric designs buried with the carved side face down. Decorative ceramics, glass beads, iron tools, decorative disks worn in the ears, spindle whorls, and miniature clay jars were also uncovered. "

MUNICH, GERMANY— New Scientist reports that Egyptians living some 3,500 years ago may have eaten watermelons similar to those we enjoy today. Botanists Susanne Renner of the University of Munich and Guillaume Chomicki of the University of Oxford analyzed a tiny piece of one of the ancient watermelon leaves that were discovered in an Egyptian tomb and sent to botanist Joseph Hooker in London in the late nineteenth century. Fortunately, the partial genome sequence the researchers obtained from the artifact contained genes related to color and taste. This melon plant did not produce the bitter cucurbitacins found in Africa’s wild, round watermelons. It also lacked a functioning gene for transforming the red pigment lycopene into another substance, which means the plant produced fruit with red flesh. Ancient Egyptian images of watermelons depict them with an elongated shape, but the partial gene sequence did not reveal the contours of this particular plant's fruit. Renner said the analysis also suggests the plant was related to sweet watermelons with white flesh that are grown to this day in Sudan. "

BENTLEY, AUSTRALIA— Live Science reports that a carved piece of canary-yellow glass worn as pectoral ornament by Egypt’s King Tutankhamun was likely formed by ground-based shock waves initiated by a meteorite impact some 29 million years ago. Aaron Cavosie of Curtin University led a team of researchers who analyzed grains of the mineral zircon found in similar pieces of glass recovered in the Libyan desert. It had been previously suggested that such yellow glass could have been formed by the heat and pressure created by an asteroid that exploded near the Earth, in an event known as an airburst. But Cavosie and his colleagues detected evidence that the zircon in the glass samples had transformed from reidite, a mineral only formed under pressure so intense it must have been triggered by an actual meteor impact. Cavosie explained that although airbursts happen more frequently than meteor impacts, they do not cause as much damage. "

Ryan Duggins of the Bureau of Archaeological Research for the Florida Department of State said the site, which was discovered in 2016, was once a shallow, freshwater burial pond that was used for about 1,000 years before it was innundated by the rising waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Surveys in 2017 revealed a six-foot-deep bed of peat containing human remains, an infilled river channel, and three infilled springs. Charred wood at the northern end of the site has been dated to between 8,949 and 8,200 years ago. "

PORT ANGELES, WASHINGTON—Evidence for as many as five tsunamis has been detected at an ancient Klallam village site on the north coast of Washington State’s Olympic Peninsula, according to a Jefferson Public Radio report. Klallam oral history tells of a wise man who warned the people to prepare for flooding when they noticed their fresh water turning salty, as could happen with the displacement of a large amount of water. Archaeologist Sarah Sterling of Portland State University participated in the excavation of the village site of Tse-whit-zen in 2004. She said she found thin, clear layers of marine sand on top of wrecked houses and hearths, with a new village built over them. Her team of researchers also discovered signs of scouring and backwash deposits, she said. “What we have I think are cultural rubble draped across beach features,” Sterling said. “So it’s been entrained by the wave, washed back and forth, and left in these S-shaped swash deposits. I think those are from the tsunami as well.” Tsunami models indicate the waves were up to 20 feet tall. Gaps in radiocarbon dates for the site, which was occupied over a period of some 2,700 years, correlate with known major earthquakes, Sterling noted. "

NEW YORK, NEW YORK—Roderick Campbell of New York University and Zhipeng Li of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences reviewed the burials of sacrificed dogs from multiple Shang Dynasty sites, according to a Live Science report, and found that nearly three-quarters were under one year of age at the time of death. The Shang Dynasty ruled the area known as the Yellow River Valley, which covers much of northern China, from about 1600 to 1050 B.C. In many cases, the dogs’ remains were placed in pits located beneath the torso of the grave’s human occupant. Some of the animals may have even been buried alive. Had the animals been pets, Campbell explained, the researchers would have found dogs of a much wider range of ages. Inscriptions on oracle bones suggest that dogs were sacrificed as offerings to the gods of the sky. The puppies may have also been intended to represent the services of a guard dog for the deceased in the afterlife. The dogs may have been bred for the purpose of sacrifice, but Campbell said it was more likely they were captured strays. "

WARSAW, POLAND— Science in Poland reports that a young man buried some 1,200 years ago at the site of Huarmey in northern coastal Peru may have been a metallurgist, based upon the well-worn bronze saw, ax, knives, and chisels with bone handles recovered from his grave by a team of researchers led by Miłosz Giersz of the University of Warsaw's Institute of Archaeology. A key additional clue to the man's profession was a sample of slag, or rocky waste produced during the refining of metal from ore. The young man, who was about 20 years old at the time of death, was placed in a sitting position, and wrapped in fabric decorated with a design imprinted with wet clay. The tools were also wrapped in fabric, some of which has survived. Giersz and Branden Rizzuto of the University of Toronto analyzed the content of the metal and concluded it is an alloy of copper and arsenic. “Arsenic alloy guaranteed that these were really hard tools that could be used for a variety of farm and carving jobs, as well as war weapons,” Giersz said. A pattern engraved on the saw may have been a maker’s signature, Giersz added. "

The rock shelter is thought to have been a funerary enclosure where members of the Tiwanaku state may have held ceremonies believed to enable contact with the dead. Radiocarbon dating indicates the artifacts, including a leather bag, wooden snuffing tablets and a snuffing tube carved with human-like figures, llama-bone spatulas, a textile headband, bits of dried plants, and a pouch made from three fox snouts stitched together, are approximately 1,000 years old. The scientists suggest plant matter may have been ground and prepared for use in the snuffing tablets and inhaled with the tube. Because none of the plants these psychoactive chemicals are made from are native to the region, the scientists suggest travelling shamans may have carried their own supplies, or the Tiwanaku may have obtained them through trade networks. "

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS—According to a Popular Science report, the production of chicha, a light, sour beer-like beverage usually made from corn, helped to spread the influence of the Wari Empire throughout what is now Peru between A.D. 450 and 1000. Archaeologist Ryan Williams of the Field Museum and his colleagues analyzed the chemical makeup of clay vessels found at a brewery in Cerro Baul, a town at the empire’s southern edge, and found they had been crafted from local materials with Wari iconography. Analysis of chicha residues on the pottery revealed the batch had been brewed from pepper berries, which can grow during drought. Remains of pepper berries were also recovered from the brewery site. Chicha remains drinkable for only about one week, requiring it to be made locally, and because breweries are a common feature at Wari sites, Williams suggests beer brewing and drinking may have been a local activity that brought the Wari people together. “Even in environmentally bad times, [Wari] could continue to kind of maintain this interaction with their population through this production of beer,” Williams said.

Some of the 28 people whose remains were discovered in a large defensive complex at the town of Agaligmiut, which is now often called Nunalleq, had been tied with grass rope before being killed, Knecht said. Most of the victims were women, children, and older men. “They were face down and some of them had holes in the back of their skulls from [what] looks like a spear or an arrow.” The complex in which the bodies were found was burned down sometime between A.D. 1652 and 1677, a period known in Yup’ik oral tradition for a conflict that began over an injury to a boy during a game of darts and escalated into the “bow and arrow wars.” “There’s a number of different tales,” Knecht explained. “What we do know is that the bow and arrow wars were during a period of time [called] the Little Ice Age, where it went from quite a bit warmer than it is now to quite a bit colder in a very short period of time.” The change in climate may have caused a food shortage that triggered the hostilities, he added.

Made up of 85 characters based on the syllables of the Cherokee language, the syllabary used in the inscriptions was invented in the early nineteenth century by Sequoyah, a Cherokee silversmith. It was officially adopted by the Cherokee Nation in 1825, and was widely used to communicate in daily life and in print. Jan Simek of the University of Tennessee, along with scholars from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees, and the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, as well as additional colleagues worked together to understand the cave’s inscriptions. They concluded that the text commemorated a sacred game similar to the modern game of lacrosse played on April 30, 1828. The rituals conducted before the game are thought to have been presided over by Sequoyah’s son, Richard Guess, whose name appears in an adjoining inscription. A third inscription, reading “I am your grandson,” was found written backwards on the ceiling of the cave and is thought to have been a message for Cherokee ancestors and other supernatural beings. The Cherokee were forced westward from these ancestral lands on the Trail of Tears in the 1830s. "

CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA— Cosmos Magazine reports that Hannah James of Australian National University and her colleagues dated teeth from the remains of seven adults and one child recovered from a prehistoric burial mound discovered in southwestern France in 2006. Known as Le Tumulus des Sables, the mound contained a jumble of bones from at least 20 adults and 10 children, and an assortment of pottery, much of which was made in the Bell Beaker style. Previous dates obtained for two bone fragments discovered in the mound fell within France’s Bell Beaker period, or between 2500 and 1800 B.C. “It’s one of [the] first cultures which spreads out all across Europe,” James explained. The new dates indicate that an additional six of the individuals buried in the mound also lived during France’s Bell Beaker period, but one person lived much earlier, between 3650 and 3522 B.C., and another lived much later, sometime between 1277 and 1121 B.C. This range of dates suggests the mound was in use for more than 2,000 years. Analysis of strontium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotopes in the teeth suggests that all but one of the adults grew up near the burial mound. "

Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, said blocks from Khuwy’s tomb were removed and reused in antiquity, but an L-shaped offering chamber that was once decorated with reliefs remains at the site. On the north wall of the tomb’s superstructure, archaeologists led by Mohamed Megahed found a descending corridor leading to a vestibule. On the southern side, there is an antechamber decorated with images of the owner of the tomb at an offering table. Megahed said the burial chamber was filled with the rubble of a limestone sarcophagus that was destroyed in antiquity. Khuwy’s mummified remains were also recovered. Setibhor’s name was found in an inscription on a red granite column in a portico at what had been an unidentified pyramid complex containing architectural elements usually reserved for Old Kingdom kings. Megahed and his team suggest that Setibhor may have helped her husband, King Djedkare, ascend the throne of Egypt, and that he appears to have honored her in return with the large pyramid complex. "

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND— Cosmos reports that Marcos Martinón-Torres of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues analyzed well-preserved bronze weapons found with the terracotta army in the tomb of Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of China, who ruled from 221 to 210 B.C. It had been suggested that the weapons remained in good condition because they were coated with a thin layer of rust-resistant chromium salt oxide, but Martinón-Torres and his team found traces of chromium on just 37 of the 464 weapons they tested. Moreover, the presence of chromium on a weapon did not correlate with how well it was preserved. Chromium was found most often at the point where the blade would have met a wooden haft or handle, and was only rarely found on the blade of a sword or the point of an arrow. Martinón-Torres and his colleagues think chromium may have been applied to the wooden parts of weapons, and that any chromium that they detected on the metal parts of weapons was probably contamination from treated wood that had rotten away. Plentiful amounts of chromium were also found in the lacquer used to coat the warriors. "

POOLE, ENGLAND—The Hyksos people, thought to have originated in West Asia, may have come to power in Egypt some 3,650 years ago by marrying into local royal families, according to a Science News report. It had been previously thought that the Hyksos rulers of Egypt’s 15th Dynasty took power by force. Biological anthropologist Christina Stantis of Bournemouth University and her colleagues analyzed strontium isotopes in the teeth of 71 individuals whose remains were unearthed at Tell el-Dab’a, the site of the Hyksos capital in the Nile Delta. About half of the remains in the sample dated to hundreds of years before Hyksos rule, while the rest dated to the period of the Hyksos dynasty. The strontium levels indicate that most of the women buried in elite graves shortly before the Hyksos came to power grew up eating plants and animals raised outside the Nile Valley. By contrast, all but a few of the elite males from this time period were found to have grown up locally. Stantis suggests the nonlocal women were Hyksos women who may have married into Egyptian royal families after moving to the Nile Delta. The study also suggests that about half of the men and women buried in the cemetery during the period of Hyksos rule came to Tell el-Dab’a from elsewhere. Further analysis could reveal where they originated. "

AGRA, INDIA—According to a report in The Hindu , the restoration of two Mughal period gardens in the Indian city of Agra has been carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the World Monuments Fund (WMF), and the Indian Ministry of Culture. One of the gardens surrounds the tomb of I’timād-ud-Daulah, which was commisioned by the Mughal empress Nur Jahan for her father, Mirza Ghiyas Beg, in the early 1620s. The monument was constructed in the charbagh style of the period, typified by four square gardens of equal size with a mausoleum at the center. Researchers believe the tomb served as a model for the nearby Taj Mahal, and is often referred to as the ""baby Taj."" The other restored garden, known as Mehtab Bagh, or ""moonlight garden,"" is just a short distance from the Taj Mahal itself. Vasant Kumar Sawarkar, superintending archaeologist of the ASI's Agra Circle district, said the remnants of the gardens—which had mostly reverted to agricultural land by the beginning of the British Raj period—were destroyed by engineers who removed trees, installed walkways, and leveled ground. The team has consulted historical records and paintings, and conducted excavations to recreate what they believe would have been typical Mughal gardens, substituting chaotic flower beds and bountiful fruit trees for the manicured lawns favored by British administrators.

Kate Liszka of the Wadi el-Hudi Expedition and California State University, San Bernardino, said Middle Kingdom pharaohs mined amethyst for jewelry and gave it to princesses and other elite members of society. She also said it is not clear whether the mine was worked by slaves, but that some of the engravings suggest the 1,000 to 1,500 miners were proud of their work. No remains have been unearthed at the site, so workers who died may have been carried back to the Nile Valley for burial. Other inscriptions indicate that soldiers watched the work at the mines.

HAIFA, ISRAEL—According to a Live Science report, evidence from trash mounds near the site of Elusa, which is located in Israel’s Negev Desert, reflect the city’s struggles at the onset of the Late Antique Little Ice Age and the Justinian plague. Guy Bar-Oz of the University of Haifa and his colleagues recovered pottery fragments, seeds, olive pits, charcoal, and traces of foods imported from the Red Sea and the Nile River. Radiocarbon dating of organic material in the trash mounds suggests they were used over a period of about 150 years, up until the mid-sixth century A.D., when the trash deposits stopped. This suggests there had been a failure in the trash-collection infrastructure. It had been previously thought that the Byzantine Empire enjoyed widespread economic success during this period, as Emperor Justinian expanded his rule across Europe, Africa, and Asia, Bar-Oz explained. “Instead, we are seeing a signal for what was really going on at that time and which has long been nearly invisible to most archaeologists—that the empire was being plagued by climatic disaster and disease,” he said. The region fell to Islamic rule in the seventh century. "

The offerings, placed in stone boxes, include the remains of a jaguar dressed as a warrior; a young boy dressed as Huitzilopochtli, the war and sun god; a set of flint knives enhanced with mother of pearl and precious stones; a pink bird known as a roseate spoonbill; and bars of copal incense. Archaeologist Leonardo Lopez Lujan of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History said that a wooden disc bearing Huitzilopochtli’s emblem was found on the jaguar’s back. An atlatl was also placed in the box, which was covered with shells, a red starfish from the Pacific Ocean, and coral, perhaps to represent the sun’s overnight journey through the watery underworld. The boy also wore a wooden disc bearing Huitzilopochtli’s emblem, and a bead necklace made of jade from Central America. Wings made of hawk bones were attached to his shoulders. The cremated remains of three Aztec kings are thought to have been buried near the circular platform between 1469 and 1502 along with luxurious offerings, according to accounts written after the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521.

AARHUS, DENMARK—Isotope geochemist Rasmus Andreasen of Aarhus University and his colleagues suggest that the presence of modern, strontium-rich agricultural lime in the landscape may have skewed earlier interpretations of the Egtved Girl and Skrydstrup Woman, according to a Live Science report. Previous analysis of isotopes obtained from the Bronze Age remains indicated that the Egtved Girl may have grown up in southern Germany, and traveled between Denmark and another location in the last years of her life, before she died in Denmark. Skrydstrup Woman was also thought to have arrived in Denmark as a teenager. But Andreasen grew concerned that the maps of strontium distributions on which these conclusions were based did not reflect conditions prior to the introduction of modern farming techniques. After adjusting for the presence of agricultural lime, Andreasen and his team members say the data suggests the women may have actually spent their lives within about six miles of where they were buried. The researchers behind the original studies are unconvinced, however. “Overall, there is nothing in the study from Aarhus which changes our interpretation: That the two women from the Bronze Age came from afar,” said Karin Frei, a professor of archaeometry at the National Museum of Denmark, and Robert Frei, a professor of geology and geochemistry at the University of Copenhagen.

DUBLIN, IRELAND— The Journal reports that a new study of Ireland’s ""bog butter"" has been conducted by Richard Evershed of the University of Bristol, Jessica Smyth of University College Dublin, and their colleagues. They dated 32 bog butters held at the National Museum of Ireland, and analyzed samples of the fats to determine whether they were actually milk fats or fats from animal carcasses. The results of the tests indicate that the waxy substances are indeed degraded butter, and push back the origin of the practice of storing butter in bogs by some 1,500 years. In fact, five of the samples date to the Bronze Age. The oldest sample, which dates to around 1700 B.C., is thought to have been wrapped in bark. Smyth said the dairy products may have simply been stored in the cool, low-oxygen, high-acid environment of bogs in order to preserve them for future consumption, or they may have been offerings, just as gold, axes, and other bladed weapons were deposited in bogs during the Bronze Age.

NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA— Live Science reports that a team of researchers including John Verano of Tulane University and Gabriel Prieto of the National University of Trujillo have examined the remains of 140 children and 200 young llamas who were sacrificed by Peru’s Chimú culture some 550 years ago. “It’s the largest child sacrifice event in the archaeological record anywhere in the world,” Verano said. “And it’s the largest sacrifice with llamas in South America.” Marks on the breastbones and displaced ribs suggest the chests of some of the victims were cut open, perhaps to remove their hearts. The Chimú farmed lands along Peru’s usually arid coastline, and used canals to provide water for their crops and livestock. At the burial site, however, human and animal footprints have been found in what was at the time of the sacrifice a layer of mud. The researchers think torrential rains brought on by El Niño conditions may have flooded the region, prompting the sacrifice as a means of asking the gods for relief. Verano said an examination of the children’s carefully arranged remains indicates most of them were in good health at the time of death, and that they ranged in age from five to 14 years old. Not all of the children, however, were locals. Some, who also had shaped heads, came from other parts of the Chimú state, according to analysis of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in their remains. The bodies of all of the children were wrapped in cotton shrouds, and many were buried in groups of three, arranged from youngest to oldest. Some of the older children wore cotton headdresses, and others had red cinnabar on their faces. The llamas were placed next to the children, or on top of their bodies. "

YOGHBI, QATAR— The Gulf Times reports that an early Islamic period settlement site has been found in the desert of northwest Qatar by a team of researchers led by Jose Carvajal Lopez of UCL Qatar. The excavations uncovered stone building foundations, fragments of glass, metals, stone vessels, and fishing tools dating to the seventh and eighth centuries A.D. It had been previously thought that occupation of this region was linked to development of trade routes on the Indian Ocean and the founding of the city of Baghdad in the late eighth century. “At this time there was a well-attested Christian presence in the region,” said Rob Carter of UCL Qatar, “so the discoveries at Yoghbi have the potential to shed light on this critical moment of religious change.” "

KATHMANDU, NEPAL—According to a report in The Kathmandu Post , reconstruction of the earthquake-damaged Rani Pokhari, or Queen’s Pond, has begun. The square reservoir, with a causeway leading to the Balgopaleshwor temple in its center, was built in Kathmandu in the seventeenth century by King Pratap Malla for his wife after the death of their son. Sushil Gyawali of Nepal’s National Reconstruction Authority said the first phase of the project will focus on the reconstruction of the pond and its water-collection systems using soil, sand, brick, and other traditional building materials. The second phase will reconstruct the temple and its bridge. Conservationists objected to earlier plans to fix the monument with concrete. “It’s a matter of honor for us that the government has shown concern in preserving our heritage in its original form,” said activist Ganapati Lal Shrestha.

MEXICO CITY, MEXICO—The Associated Press reports that Guillermo de Anda of Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History and his colleagues visited Balamku, a narrow underground cave situated nearly two miles from Chichen Itza’s main pyramid of Kukulkan, and found more than 150 ancient Maya vessels containing bone fragments and burned offerings of food, seeds, jade, and shells. The ceramic items include braziers and incense burners that bear the image of Tlaloc, a rain god noted for his mustache and blinders. The researchers suggest the offerings may have been intended to ask Tlaloc for rain during unusual periods of drought in the Late Classic (A.D. 700–800) and the Terminal Classic (A.D. 800–1000) periods. The exploration of Balamku is part of the Great Maya Aquifer Project, which is investigating Chichen Itza’s underground water system and searching Balamku for a possible connection to a cenote cave believed to rest under Kukulkan. The team members plan to create 3-D maps of the cave while leaving the artifacts in place. "

THANH HOA, VIETNAM—According to a Vietnam News Agency report, four layers of pagoda foundations have been uncovered on Xuan Dai Mountain, which is located in Vietnam’s north central coast region. The earliest construction is thought to date to the tenth century A.D. Pillars and tiles dating to the Tran Dynasty (1225–1400), glazed ceramic tiles from the Late Le Dynasty (1428–1527), and intricately carved pillars and metal nails from the Le Trung Hung Dynasty (1533–1789) were also found. Nguyen Duc Binh of the Vietnam Archaeology Institute said the pagoda was eventually dedicated to Princess Du Anh, daughter of King Tran Nghe Tong, who was successfully treated with herbs for an illness at the pagoda in the late fourteenth century. She is thought to have managed renovations of the building, including the additions of statues and a bell to the structure, which was then named for her. “As the excavation site is small, we still cannot see the whole scale of the structures,” Binh said. “The site needs to be further excavated in order to gather enough evidence and information for future preservation.” "

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7443-190301-cambodia-angkor-elites,South&Southeast Asia,"New Thoughts on the Causes of Angkor’s Decline. SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA—According to a Science News report, analysis of sediments from the moat surrounding Cambodia’s Angkor Thom suggests its ruing elites gradually abandoned the medieval walled city, beginning in the early fourteenth century. It had been previously thought that the hundreds of thousands of residents who lived in the Greater Angkor region left suddenly in the mid-fifteenth century, perhaps due to a military defeat or catastrophic damage to the extensive water infrastructure system brought on by climate change. Geoscientist Dan Penny of the University of Sydney and his colleagues found that evidence of burning, forest disturbances, and soil erosion in the form of traces of plants, pollen, and minerals in the sediment cores decreased throughout the fourteenth century. At the same time, pollen from floating vegetation in the moat increased, indicating that the moat was not being maintained as it once had been. The rest of the city’s extensive water system may have also failed for lack of repairs, Penny said. He thinks the elites may have moved closer to the coastline to pursue profits in the sea trade, leaving the city vulnerable to decline and open to invasion. "

PULLMAN, WASHINGTON— Live Science reports that an object in storage at Washington State University has been identified as a 2,000-year-old tool used by ancestral Pueblo people living in what is now southeastern Utah to create tattoos. The nearly four-inch-long pen was made from two prickly pear cactus spines tied to a handle of skunkbush sumac with yucca-leaf strips. Andrew Gillreath-Brown of Washington State University analyzed its sharp, pointed ends with a scanning electron microscope and found that the black stains contain carbon, which is often used as pigment. He also attempted to create tattoos with a replica pen on fresh pig skin. The tool pushes back evidence for the practice of tattooing in western North America by more than 1,000 years, Gillreath-Brown said. Similar implements have been found in Arizona and New Mexico, but the oldest has been dated to between A.D. 1100 and 1280. "

BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA—According to a Vancouver Sun report, shellfish gardens on Quadra Island beaches were built by First Nations peoples at least 3,500 years ago, or about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought. First Nations elders said the gardens, in addition to increasing the number of littleneck and butter clams living in the waters, would have also created good places to fish. Nicole Smith of the Hakai Institute said the rock-walled gardens and terraces were radiocarbon dated with barnacle scars left on the building materials. “If the rock came from another part of the intertidal zone and it was turned upside down during construction, [the barnacle scar] can be preserved in the sediment in an anaerobic environment,” she said. Clam shells in the wall were also dated, she added. Rising and falling sea levels would have required the communities that maintained the shellfish gardens to move them to maximize productivity and food security. “If it wasn’t productive it would just be in the way,” explained Dana Lepofsky of Simon Fraser University.

Leah Di Segni of the Hebrew University translated a Greek inscription in the structure’s mosaic floor that reads, “Only God help the beautiful property of Master Adios, amen.” The title “master” indicates that Adios had attained high social standing, said Hagit Torge of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The researchers also suggest Adios was a Samaritan, since Samaritan culture flourished in the region during the fifth century A.D., and an ancient Samaritan synagogue has been discovered nearby at Tel Zur Natan. Adios is thought to have made his fortune selling wine from the Holy Land to Christians living in the Byzantine Empire. Torge suggests he may have lived on top of what is now Tel Zur Natan. "

MADISON, WISCONSIN— The Independent reports that Sissel Schroeder of the University of Wisconsin and her colleagues analyzed fecal stanols found in sediment cores taken from Illinois’ Horseshoe Lake to track population changes at Cahokia, an ancient city on the Mississippi River. Fecal stanols are produced in the human gut during digestion and are eliminated from the body as waste. Archaeological evidence suggests the population of Cahokia grew between A.D. 600 and 1100, was in decline by 1200, and that the city had been abandoned by 1400. The team, which also included AJ White of California State University, suggests that when the ancient city's population was higher, more human waste would be expected to have washed into Horseshoe Lake, leaving behind higher levels of stanols. Schroeder said the concentration of fecal stanols in the different layers of the sediment cores did rise and fall over time in accord with previous population estimates. The researchers tied their population study to an earlier one that found evidence of significant Mississippi River flooding around A.D. 1150, and they looked for additional evidence of changing climate conditions in the form of different levels of oxygen isotopes in the sediment cores. They found a likely drop in summer rainfall, which was necessary for farming, at about the time Cahokia began to decline. "

ITOSHIMA, JAPAN— The Mainichi reports that Yasuo Yanagida of Kokugakuin University suggests ink stones may have been manufactured in southwestern Japan as early as the second century B.C. This is based upon his study of stone artifacts from the site of the Uruujitokyu ruins in Itoshima, the Nakabaru ruins in Karatsu, and the Higashi Oda Mine ruins in Chikuzen. It had been previously thought that writing emerged in Japan around the third century A.D., based upon the discovery of pottery decorated with written characters. Ink stones, which are generally thin, flat, fan-shaped, and polished on one side, are thought to have originated in China in the third century B.C. Ink stones dating to the first century have been previously unearthed in southwestern Japan, but they were believed to have been imported. Some of the possible ink stones recently identified by Yanagida had been broken before they were completed. Artifacts from the sites also include unfinished stone files for making ink from the ink stones, and stone saws. “There was a demand for the written word,” Yanagida explained, “and that’s why [the ink stones] were being made. I suspect [Japanese producers] copied Chinese stones and began making them domestically.” "

The Caucasus region stretches from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, and includes part or all of what is now Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, and Turkey. Wolfgang Haak of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History suggested that Bronze Age farmers living in the southern Caucasus likely spread north over the mountains, where they met nomads from the Eurasian steppe, some of whom were related to Yamnaya groups to the northwest. Other steppe-dwellers, such as the Steppe Maykop, had genes resembling those found in Paleolithic Siberians, ancient Native Americans, and modern North Asians, he said. Some of these groups met in an interaction zone, where they were likely to have exchanged genes along with cultural, technological, and social innovations such as effective metal weapons, the wheel, and the wagon.

Polish team leader Magdalena Krzemień of Jagiellonian University suggested some of the artifacts had been used in religious rituals to the north of the island, perhaps to honor Chaak, a rain god. For example, divers found three stacked bowls that had been placed on larger three-legged vessels, one of which held a nearly eight-inch-long obsidian blade. “Its presence is clearly associated with ritual and sacrifice,” Krzemień said. The top bowl in the stack held fragments of burned wood and obsidian. “It is a mystery how the Mayans were able to deposit the offering so that the vessels did not scatter over a larger surface,” added underwater archaeologist Mateusz Popek of Nicolaus Copernicus University. “We suspect that they were dropped to the bottom in a net.” The main sponsors of the expedition are Sebastian Lambert and Iga Snopek.

LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM— BBC reports that a team of scientists from University College London have determined that European colonization of the New World caused the death of so many indigenous people that the event, known as the “Great Dying,” may have impacted the world's climate. Led by geographer Alexander Koch, the team calculated that some 60 million people lived in the Americas before European contact, and that the population dropped to just five or six million within a hundred years as a result of newly introduced diseases, warfare, and social upheavel. The demographic collapse allowed cleared land equal to the area of France to be reclaimed by forest and savannah. The team hypothesizes that the new vegetation would have taken enough carbon from the atmosphere to cause global surface temperatures to fall, resulting in a cooling period known to history as the “Little Ice Age.” "

The four-sided fort was protected by a moat on its northern, eastern, and southern sides, and by the Sandul River to the west. Gates, each guarded by a deity, were placed in each of the four cardinal directions. Circular structures within the fort were formed with wedge-shaped bricks and terracotta tiles. “The Asurgarh people during that time probably used stone rubbles and tile fragments for flooring their houses and the streets,” Garnayak said. “Besides, silver punch-marked coins, silver and copper toe ring[s] and earrings, [and] and beads of carnelian, jasper, beryl, garnet, agate, and coral have been found.” The coral beads and silver coins suggest the people living at the fort traded with seafaring people, Garnayak added.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS— Live Science reports that a carving of a man and a woman recovered from a 3,500-year-old shrine in a villa at Tell Edfu, in southern Egypt, may have been damaged in antiquity by someone who wanted to erase the couple’s existence in the afterlife. Nadine Moeller of the Tell Edfu Project and the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute said the shrine may have been dedicated to the ancestors of those who lived in the villa. The faces of the man and woman, along with identifying hieroglyphics, were scratched out of the sculpture, so the researchers are trying to reconstruct the information. “For the ancient Egyptians, being remembered after death was very important, so they would receive offerings in the netherworld,” Moeller explained. “By erasing someone’s name, you are also taking away their identity and the good deeds they did during their lifetimes for which they will be remembered after death.” Other artifacts recovered from the shrine could offer clues to help solve the puzzle, Moeller said. For example, a black diorite statuette depicts a scribe identified in hieroglyphic inscriptions as “Juf,” but scholars at this point do not know whether he is the same man shown in the damaged carving.

The burial consists of a tomb containing the remains of two 12-year-old children, an adult whose remains may have come from an earlier burial, and the remains of eight people ranging in age from 11 to 20, whose bodies had been positioned outside the tomb. In an Antiquity article, Hassett and Sağlamtimur suggest these eight people may have been sacrificed, based upon evidence of trauma on two of the skeletons, possibly as “retainers” who would accompany and serve others in the afterlife. The others may have also received wounds that did not leave marks on their bones. “As a grim example, stab wounds are normally aimed at the soft parts of the body, which do not preserve,” Hassett said. The children in the tomb were also accompanied by hundreds of bronze spearheads, while the possible retainers left outside the tomb were buried with textiles, beads, and ceramics. Hassett added that the children within the tomb may have also been sacrificed, but, “[u]nfortunately, preservation wasn’t great inside the chamber,” making it difficult to determine how they died. "

KRAKÓW, POLAND—According to a Science in Poland report, a team of researchers led by Wiesław Koszkul and Jarosław Źrałka of the Institute of Archaeology at Jagiellonian University have uncovered a stone structure at Guatemala’s Maya site of Nakum that may have served as the foundation of a steam bath as early as 700 B.C. The excavators first discovered the entrance to a tunnel carved out of rock in an area of the site surrounded by temples, pyramids, and palaces. The tunnel leads to a set of stairs, and then a second tunnel, which ends in a rectangular room with rock-cut benches. An oval hearth in the wall opposite the entrance to the room is thought to have been used to heat large stones. Water would then have been poured over them to create steam. Koszkul and Źrałka suggest the excess water would have flowed into a hollow in the middle of the bath’s rock floor, and out of the structure through a drain channel in the tunnels. The researchers also found pottery and obsidian tools in the tunnels, which may have been used during rituals held in the steam bath. The structure was completely sealed with mortar and rubble around 300 B.C., Koszkul said, perhaps as result of social and religious changes in Maya society. "

WASHINGTON, D.C.— Smithsonian Magazine reports that Nicole Smith-Guzmán of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and her colleagues examined 125 skulls from nine pre-Columbian burial sites in Panama, and found bony growths in the ear canals of seven men and one woman. Three of the men with the growths were buried together. The growths, known as external auditory exostoses, or surfers’ ear, are thought to form as a reaction to long exposure to cold wind and water. And although Panama is a tropical country, water temperatures in the Gulf of Panama drop between January and April, when trade winds from the north blow warm surface water out into the Pacific Ocean, and colder water rises to the surface. Smith-Guzmán suggested the growths could indicate that early Panamanians spent a lot of time in deep waters to retrieve thorny oysters, giant conch, and pearl oysters, rather than the occurrence of fungal or bacterial infections, since the condition appeared mostly in males. If the growths had been caused by illness, they would have appeared in both men and women at about the same rate, she reasoned. Further research will compare ancient and modern examples of surfers’ ear across the region, Smith-Guzmán added. "

ZIBO, CHINA— Live Science reports that a miniature terracotta army, complete with hundreds of statues of cavalry, chariots, infantry, watchtowers, and musicians, has been discovered in a pit in northeastern China. Researchers from the Cultural Relics Agency of Linzi District of Zibo City and the Shandong Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology estimate the army was placed in the pit some 2,100 years ago, or about 100 years after a life-sized terracotta army was buried near the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. This army, whose soldiers stand between nine and 12 inches tall, is thought to have been created for Liu Hong, son of Han Dynasty Emperor Wu, who reigned from 141 to 87 B.C. The presence of the pit and its army, arranged in a formation usually reserved for the burials of monarchs or high-ranking officials, suggests there should be a royal burial mound nearby, but the archaeologists think it may have been destroyed decades ago during railway construction.

Shi Jiazhen of the Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology in Luoyang said the transparent yellow liquid still smells like wine, but will be chemically analyzed to determine its ingredients. During the Western Han period, from 202 B.C. to A.D. 8, alcoholic beverages were made from rice or sorghum, and were stored in elaborate bronze containers for use in ceremonies and rituals. The vessel containing the liquid was one of two large bronze items in the tomb. The other is a lamp shaped like a wild goose. "

The octagonal tomb measures about 12 feet tall and contains an archway painted red. It has a floor made with black bricks, and its walls are outlined in black and decorated with poems and murals, including images of flower stands and red vases. “A total of four poems were inscribed on the surrounding walls with regular script to depict the scenery in late spring,” said Zhao Hui of the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology. Two skeletons were also found in the tomb. Zhao said the tomb’s decorations might reflect the traditional tomb style of the period, or may have been based upon the owners’ personal preferences. "

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA—According to a Science News report, computer simulations suggest that heavy monsoon rains following decades of drought triggered failures in the extensive water system at Cambodia’s medieval city of Angkor Wat. Geoscientist Dan Penny of the University of Sydney said that during periods of intense rainfall, some of the earthen channels carrying water eroded and widened, which, combined with accumulations of sediment in other areas of the network, eventually led to uneven flow throughout the system. It had been previously thought that the city's abandonment in the fifteenth century was the result of a war with a neighboring kingdom and, possibly, the rise of Buddhism over Hinduism, but Penny and his colleagues think climate-induced infrastructure collapse could be to blame for the city’s demise.

BAYT RAS, JORDAN—According to a CNRS News report, an international team of archaeologists has excavated a tomb dating to the second-century A.D. in Jordan at the ancient site of Capitolias. Its walls are decorated with more than 250 figures of humans, animals, and gods, as well as a large painting illustrating the construction of a rampart along with 60 inscriptions describing what the figures in the painting were doing. In its entirety, the artwork is thought to describe the founding of the city. Jean-Baptiste Yon of the History and Sources of Ancient Worlds Laboratory (HiSoMA) said the captions, written in Aramaic with Greek letters, resemble the speech bubbles in modern comics. “These teeming figures compose a narrative that is arranged on either side of a central painting, which represents a sacrifice offered by an officiant to the tutelary deities of Capitolias and Caesarea Maritima, the provincial capital of Judaea,” said HiSoMA’s Julien Aliquot. The person buried in the tomb may have officiated at a similar sacrifice when the city was founded, explained Pierre-Louis Gatier, also a member of the HiSoMA research team. “His name has not yet been identified, although it could be engraved on the lintel of the door, which has not yet been cleared,” he said. The other images show peasants and oxen gathering fruit and tending grapevines, woodcutters chopping down trees with the help of the gods, and stone cutters and architects transporting materials on camels and donkeys at a construction site.

BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA—Scientists are developing a technique to estimate ancient populations based on biomarkers found in the feces of humans and other some animals, according to a Smithsonian report. A.J. White of the University of California, Berkeley, explained that coprostanol, a molecule produced in the human gut through the digestion of cholesterol, can be found in sediments and measured. The technique was tested at Cahokia, a site in southern Illinois occupied between A.D. 1050 and 1350 and known for its earthen structures. The researchers found that the levels of coprostanol and other by-products of digestion in samples taken from Cahokia’s Horseshoe Lake correspond with population estimates over time, based on the ancient city’s archaeological record. “I don’t see this as something which will replace former methods of estimating population, but rather can supplement our knowledge in a new way where traditional methods can’t,” White said. The technique could also help archaeologists estimate the size of ancient hunter-gatherer groups and early domesticated animal herds. "

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6800-180718-corn-fungus-staple,Native American,"Corn Fungus May Have Kept Ancestral Puebloans Healthy. HIGHLAND PARK, TEXAS— Cosmos Magazine reports that Jenna Battillo of Southwestern Methodist University says that consuming a fungus that grows on corn allowed the ancestral Puebloans to survive on a corn-based diet beginning around 400 B.C. and lasting for a period of about 800 years. Corn is thought to have comprised about 80 percent of the calories consumed by the people of the Basketmaker II culture, who also ate a small amount of wild plants, and occasionally some wild rabbit, but not enough to make up for the lack of essential nutrients in their staple crop. Yet, analysis of human remains from the period have not detected signs of pellagra, a potentially fatal disease that can be caused by the lack of vitamins and amino acids in a corn-based diet. Now considered a delicacy, corn fungus, or Ustilago maydis , alters the nutritional content of corn, increasing its protein levels and boosting the levels of most of the missing amino acids. Battillo suggests the ancient practice of boiling corn with limestone, and the small amount of food consumed from other sources, may have provided enough of the key missing amino acid to keep the ancestral Puebloans healthy. The levels of corn fungus spores in the human feces found at Turkey Pen Ruin, an ancestral Pueblo site in Utah, suggests the corn fungus may have been eaten intentionally, she added. "

It had been thought that the expansion of forests in southern Japan after the last Ice Age would have shifted people’s diets towards foods obtained from hunting and gathering on land. Instead, it appears that people developed more intensive fishing strategies. The scientists were even able to determine the type of seafood from the charred, fatty deposits. Salmon was the most common fish detected in the oldest pots, which date back about 11,000 years. Other marine and freshwater fish, molluscs, and marine animals were processed and stored in the pots more frequently as the climate warmed. "

Jodi Magness of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said the mosaic floors of the Huqoq synagogue are colorful and filled with figured scenes, even though it had been previously thought that Jewish art of the period avoided the use of such images. Previously uncovered sections of the floors illustrate biblical stories such as Noah’s ark, the parting of the Red Sea, the Tower of Babel, and Samson and the foxes. Newly discovered this year is a section depicting a tale from the book of Numbers in which Moses sends 12 spies into the land of Canaan to bring back information on the region’s soil, fruit, and people.

SAN MIGUEL ISLAND, CHANNEL ISLANDS— The Ventura County Star reports that the discovery of ancient human remains on San Miguel Island in 2005 has just been announced to the public. Researchers spotted a piece human bone near an eroded ancient Chumash camp site during a survey in Channel Islands National Park. Because the grave was vulnerable to erosion, the National Park Service (NPS) alerted the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, who have ties to the Channel Islands, to the discovery. The Chumash decided to allow the excavation of the site. Dubbed “Tuqan Man,” for the traditional name of the island, the remains were removed from the grave, which had been marked with stones, and taken to the mainland for DNA testing and study. Radiocarbon dating revealed the man died between 9,800 and 10,200 years ago, and was between 40 and 50 years of age at the time of his death. Isotope analysis suggests he lived in the interior of California, not on the islands. Scientists were not able to obtain a DNA sample from the bones, however, so they were not able to find a genetic link to modern Chumash people. That meant the NPS had to publish legal notices in local newspapers before handing the bones over to the Santa Ynez Band for reburial. But no other tribe came forward to claim Tuqan Man’s remains. “We’re very happy that we could lay this man to rest,” said tribal chairman Kenneth Kahn. "

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS— Science News reports that a new genetic study supports archaeological and linguistic evidence for at least three major waves of migration into Southeast Asia over a period of 50,000 years. A team of researchers led by Mark Lipson of Harvard Medical School analyzed DNA from 18 individuals whose remains were unearthed at five different archaeological sites in Vietnam, Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. The bones ranged from 4,100 to 1,700 years old. The first wave of migration brought hunter-gatherers to Southeast Asia some 45,000 years ago. Then rice and millet farming spread into the region with migrants from southern China who mixed with the local hunter-gatherers some 4,500 years ago. The 4,000-year-old samples taken from the farmers who lived at Vietnam’s Man Bac site suggest their ancestors were hunter-gatherers and rice farmers from southern China. A third wave of migration arrived in Myanmar some 3,000 years ago, in Vietnam about 2,000 years ago, and in Thailand within the last 1,000 years.

GEORGE, UTAH— The Spectrum reports that hiker Randy Langstraat discovered a nearly intact pot estimated to be 1,000 years old in the Arizona Strip desert. After concealing the pot in situ, he contacted the Bureau of Land Management. Archaeologist Sarah Page returned to the site with Langstraat, where they found the pot undisturbed. “While the BLM is tasked to protect these resources,” she said, “we need everyone’s help to do so.” The vessel is thought to have been crafted by the Ancestral Puebloan people who lived in the region between A.D. 1050 and 1250. It has an effigy handle that may depict a deer or bighorn sheep. Pieces that may have represented the animal’s ears or horns have broken off. "

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA—According to a Live Science report, Stephen Gluckman of the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine suggests that Saladin may have been killed by typhoid. Born in what is now Tikrit, Iraq, Saladin fought against the Egyptian Fatimid Caliphate, and eventually became commander of Syrian troops in Egypt. In 1187, his army conquered Jerusalem, which led to the Third Crusade, from 1189 to 1192. Saladin died in 1193, at the age of 55 or 56, after a two-week-long illness with fever. Gluckman analyzed historical documents that recorded the sultan’s symptoms, and ruled out plague or smallpox, which kill people quickly, and tuberculosis, because there was no mention of coughing or breathing problems. Malaria, Gluckman added, is likely to have caused chills, which were not listed in the records. However, Gluckman explained, typhoid is contracted through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella typhi , and causes high fever, weakness, stomach pain, headache, and loss of appetite.

Live Science report, examination of fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls has revealed previously unseen texts. The Israel Antiquities Authority announced that the writing was spotted by researcher Oren Ableman of Hebrew University on fragments of scrolls that had been recovered from Cave 11, and appeared to be blank. Using infrared imaging, Ableman discovered Hebrew letters and words on the fragments. He was able to determine that some of the scraps had fallen from the scrolls of Deuteronomy and Leviticus, two books from the Hebrew Bible, and from the Book of Jubilees, which was written during the same period. Of the many fragments in the collection, one is thought to be from an unknown third copy of the Temple Scroll; a piece of Psalm 147:1 from the Great Psalms Scroll which suggests the ancient version of the Psalm is slightly shorter than the modern one; and a fragment bearing letters written in paleo-Hebrew that could belong to an unknown manuscript.

HANOI, VIETNAM— Vietnam Net reports that recent excavations in Hanoi’s Imperial Citadel of Thang Long have uncovered traces of large buildings dating from about A.D. 1000 to 1400 in an area to the east of the Kinh Thien Palace. The researchers uncovered the stone bases of columns and foundations, building and perimeter walls, courtyards, and drainage structures. They also unearthed pieces of the palace’s distinctive roof tiles shaped like dragons and decorated with bright yellow and green enamel. Archaeologist Tong Trung Tin said the dragon-shaped tiles, which date to the early Le Dynasty (A.D. 980 to 1009), “are exactly how they have been described in history.” The line of tubular “body” tiles began with a dragon’s head and ended with its tail. The beasts on the roof of the king’s palace had legs and feet with five claws each, while the dragons on the crown prince’s palace sported legs and feet with four claws. The excavation team members also found pottery from the Mac Dynasty dating to the early sixteenth century, but no traces of Mac architecture. Tin says this reflects the historic record, which suggests Mac Dynasty rulers repaired the palaces of their predecessors, rather than building new ones. The palace was eventually torn down by French colonialists. "

SIEM REAP, CAMBODIA—According to a report in The Nation (Thailand) , archaeologists led by Jean-Baptiste Chevance have been excavating a site they think may be the ninth-century royal palace of Jayavarman II in Phnom Kulen National Park, located in a mountain range some 20 miles north of Angkor Wat. Jayavarman II was the first ruler of the Angkor Empire. The massive compound was investigated with lidar technology in 2012. “It’s obviously one of the most important buildings because of the quality of the construction,” Chevance said. The square building, made of high-quality brick, was surrounded by a series of concentric walls. Radiocarbon dates obtained from the site suggest the building was abandoned late in the ninth century, which corresponds with inscriptions relating to the reign of Jayavarman II. No inscriptions have been found to date in the well-made building, however. "

CBC News reports that Chris Shaw of the University of New Brunswick has created a computer model to investigate possible birch-bark canoe routes through the territory inhabited by the members of the Wabanaki Confederacy. That territory stretches from Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick, across Maine and into parts of Quebec. The model analyzes data on water levels during the different seasons, and known archaeological sites of the Wabanaki nations. “Those environmental changes may have affected the ways prehistoric ancestral Wabanaki people would have moved through the landscape, the routes they would have selected, and how long it would take to move to significant places such as archaeological sites in the interior to coastlines,” Shaw said. Mallory Moran of the University of William and Mary is also studying possible First Nations canoe routes through language and place names given to portages. “Many of these routes were part of a seasonal cycle,” she explained. Sometimes the names of the routes indicate they were used for the hunting of specific animals or fish. The routes would also have been traveled to maintain relationships with neighboring nations, added Shane Perley-Dutcher of the Tobique First Nation. "

HAIFA, ISRAEL—According to a report in Haaretz , Byzantine farmers in the Negev Desert kept pigeons primarily as a source of fertilizer, and not as a source of meat. Nimrod Marom of the University of Haifa and Tel Hai College, Guy Bar-Oz and Yotam Tepper of the University of Haifa, and Baruch Rosen of the Volcani Center compared the skull and skeleton measurements of pigeons from multiple 1,500-year-old dovecotes at the sites of Shivta and Saadon, and compared them with other collections of pigeon bones. They found the Negev birds were much smaller than those known to have been bred for their meat. And, the farmers placed their dovecotes in the middle of agricultural fields, usually about one-half mile away from their own homes, which also suggests the birds were not consumed. The scientists estimate the 1,200 to 1,600 birds living in one of the dovecotes could have produced as much as 12 to 15 tons of guano per year that could be used to nourish grapes, olives, and other crops.

CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY—According to a report in The Philadelphia Inquirer , a total of some 10,000 Native American artifacts have been uncovered from two archaeological sites in Camden. Almost 1,300 artifacts were recovered at the first site, which is thought to have been a short-term camp. Among those objects, archaeologist Ilene Grossman-Bailey found a rectangular ceramic cooking vessel and a hearth containing charcola that has been dated to 1400 B.C. The second, slightly older site may have started as a temporary camp, but then it likely became a year-round settlement. It yielded ceramics; grinding and hammer stones thought to have been used to grind maize, legumes, and barley; and the burned bones of deer and other mammals, turtles, and wild fowl. A tool bearing protein residue may have been used to process the meat. Many of the artifacts at this site were recovered from a 20-foot-long ditch. “We don’t really know what it is,” said Grossman-Bailey. “There really isn’t anything else like it in New Jersey, although similar features have been found near the Chesapeake and in New England.” She thinks it may have been part of a house."

TIBERIAS, ISRAEL—The Associated Press reports that building foundations unearthed in northern Israel may have been an early mosque constructed shortly after the city of Tiberias came under Muslim rule, and not a Byzantine marketplace later converted to a mosque, as had been previously thought. At the base of the building foundations, researchers led by archaeologist Katia Cytryn-Silverman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem found mostly Roman and Byzantine coins and pottery dating to the mid-seventh century A.D. Based on these findings, they estimate that the structure was erected sometime between A.D. 660 and the 680s. Cytryn-Silverman explained that the building’s floor plan, dimensions, and prayer niche also closely resemble those of other early mosques built in Medina, Damascus, and Jerusalem. This structure, she added, was “more humble” than a larger mosque that replaced it half a century later. “At least until the monumental mosque was erected in the eighth century, the church continued being the main building in Tiberias,” Cytryn-Silverman said.

The sculptures are estimated to be about 2,000 years old, and have been damaged by erosion and construction projects. Only one or two of the images are shown with what may be a rope—otherwise, the animals are said to have been lovingly depicted in their natural state. Such artworks are rare on the Arabian Peninsula, and usually consist of geometric forms, scenes of war or hunting, or other animals. Flakes of flint tools have been found at the so-called Camel Site, but they have not been associated with the carvings. The researchers speculate the site may have been used as a boundary marker, a rest stop for caravans, or a place to venerate Al-Lat, a goddess associated with camels. "

Discovered during excavations in summer 2020, the cemetery was in use between A.D. 470 and 540, during the short-lived period of the Thuringian Kingdom. Among the 80 burials in the cemetery, the researchers have recovered imported glass bowls; gold jewelry including brooches, hairpins, and necklaces; and weapons such as swords, lances, spears, and shields. The wealthiest of the graves are thought to belong to those who lived in the manor, said archaeologist Arnold Muhl of the Halle State Museum of Prehistory. The researchers also discovered a pit holding the bones of four cattle, five horses, two dogs, and bronze fragments that may be the remains of a cauldron. The contents of the pit were removed from the site in a block for future study, Muhl explained. The positions of some of the graves suggests they were placed to avoid disturbing this pit, which may have been part of a burial mound holding the remains of an important person, he added. Chemical analysis of the bones that could reveal the birthplace of the cemetery occupants is also planned. "
