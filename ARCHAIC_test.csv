ZAGREB, CROATIA— Croatia Week reports that the remains of an Avar warrior dating to the late seventh or early eighth century A.D. have been found in a tomb in eastern Croatia, near the site of the Roman city of Cibalae. The Avars were Eurasian nomads who arrived in Europe in the sixth century A.D. and conquered other nomadic tribes. Archaeologist Anita Rapan-Papeša of the Vincovci City Museum said the man was buried with a belt. “When we observe the walled grave we have discovered, it turns out that Avars saw how Romans were buried so they made their own copies of Roman graves,” she explained. Rapan-Papeša and her team members also unearthed a grave in the cemetery that contained the remains of an Avar warrior, his horse, and bridle ornaments. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/8866-200720-measles-genome-dated,Iron Age,"New Study Suggests Measles Virus is 2,500 Years Old. BERLIN, GERMANY—According to a report in The Asahi Shimbun , a new study of the measles genome led by researchers from Germany’s Robert Koch Institute suggests that the virus may be 2,500 years old. It had been previously thought that the measles virus separated from the rinderpest virus, which is transmitted among cows, some 1,100 years ago, based upon genetic differences between the rinderpest virus and recent samples of the measles virus. The measles genomes for the new study were obtained from a lung specimen taken from a patient who died of measles in 1912, and another sample collected around 1960. Around 2,500 years ago, the researchers note, population sizes may have become large enough for a new infectious disease to emerge and spread among people living in close contact in urban areas. "

JERUSALEM, ISRAEL— Live Science reports that volunteers and archaeologists led by Saar Ganor and Itamar Weissbein of the Israel Antiquities Authority have unearthed a 3,200-year-old fortress in southern Israel, at a strategic site located along an ancient road along the Guvrin River that connected the Judea plains to the coastal plain. The Egyptian-style fortress is thought to have been built in the Egyptian-ruled land of Canaan as a defense against the Philistines, who had gained power to the west, along the Mediterranean Sea coast. The structure measures about 60 feet long and 60 feet wide, with a watchtower placed at each of its four corners. A carved rock weighing more than three tons served as the threshold at the entrance to the fortress. The entrance opened into a courtyard paved with stone slabs and central columns. Rooms on either side of the structure contained hundreds of pieces of pottery, including a bowl and cup that may have been reserved for ritual use. Ganor and Weissbein said that once the Egyptians left the region, the unprotected Canaanite cities fell, probably at the hands of the Philistines. "

ROME, ITALY— ANSA reports that Antonio Sgamellotti of the Lincei Academy and his colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of the blue pigment in the sea and sky of Triumph of Galatea , a fresco completed by the artist Raphael in 1514 in a building then known as the Palazzo Chigi. Sgamellotti said the researchers found evidence of “Egyptian blue,” a pigment thought to have been replaced after the fall of the Roman Empire with the use of lapis lazuli. Raphael may have chosen to recreate the brilliant pigment for this depiction of the heroine of a Greek myth because of his interest in the ancient world, Sgamellotti explained. In the painting, the Nereid Galatea is shown riding in a shell pulled by two dolphins. "

DORSET, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that Phillip Toms of the University of Gloucestershire will test soil samples collected from the elbows and feet of the Cerne Abbas Giant, a figure carved into a chalk hillside in southwest England, with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The technique determines when minerals in the soil were last exposed to sunlight, according to archaeologist Martin Papworth of England’s National Trust. “It is likely that the tests will give us a date range, rather than a specific age, but we hope they will help us better understand, and care for, this famous landmark,” Papworth said. The Cerne Abbas Giant was first recorded in 1694, but researchers do not know if was created at that time or in antiquity. "

GRONINGEN, NETHERLANDS—According to a statement released by the University of Groningen , scientists led by Margot Kuitems of the school’s Center for Isotope Research and their Russian colleagues have used a new radiocarbon dating technique, which is based on the presence of spikes in carbon-14 concentrations and tree-ring data, to obtain a precise date for the felling of a wooden beam in the foundation of southern Siberia’s Por-Bajin complex. Built on an island in a lake by nomadic Uyghurs, it had been thought that the complex was constructed in A.D. 750, during the reign of Bayan-Chur Khan, based on a runic inscription describing the construction of a large monument. Crafted with 40-foot-tall clay walls set on wood foundations, Por-Bajin measures 705 feet long by 530 feet wide. And although previous research suggests the complex was built over a short time period, it appears that it was never used. The new research revised the date of the construction of Por-Bajin to A.D. 777, during the reign of Tengri Bögü Khan, who had converted to the religion of Manichaeism. He was killed in an anti-Manichaean rebellion in 779. The new timeline suggests the Khan could have built the complex as a Manichaeism monastery that was no longer needed after his death. "

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK— The Copenhagen Post reports that the wreckage of the Delmenhorst , one of the first ships constructed from drawings, was found some 500 feet off the coast of Denmark during offshore construction work. The warship, now almost completely buried in the seabed, was grounded in 1644 during the Battle of Fehmarn, fought between the Danes and a Swedish and Dutch fleet as part of a brief conflict called the Torstenson War. The Danes attempted to protect the Delmenhorst with a cannon in the harbor at Rødbyhavn, but the Swedes set one of their own ships on fire and sailed it into the Delmenhorst , which also caught fire and sank. Sweden replaced Denmark as the leading power in the region after the victory. "

PORTMAHOMACK, SCOTLAND— BBC News reports that DNA analysis has determined the relationships shared by multiple people whose remains were found in a church yard in Highland Scotland in 1997. Known as the “Six-Headed Chief” burial, the grave included the bones of a man with a fatal sword wound to the skull; four additional skulls; and the skeleton of a second man thought to have been added to the grave at a later date. The bones of a third man buried in a nearby grave were also analyzed. The study suggests that the grave occupants belonged to members of the same family who lived between the late thirteenth and the early fifteenth centuries, except for one of the skulls, dated to sometime between the eighth and tenth centuries, which might have been kept by the family as the treasured relic of a Pictish monk. The two complete men’s skeletons from the grave are thought to have belonged to first cousins once removed. One of the skulls belonged to a woman who was the mother of the second man whose remains were placed in the grave. The remaining two skulls belonged to a father and son, who were grandfather and father to this same man, while the separate grave is thought to hold the remains of his son. "

LONDON, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that 144 timbers, postholes, and artifacts uncovered last year at a construction site in east London may be the remains of The Red Lion, an early Elizabethan outdoor stage with galleried seating whose exact location had been lost. John Brayne is thought to have built The Red Lion around 1567 on a medieval farmstead before he and James Burbage of The Lord Chamberlain’s Men built The Theatre, the first permanent home for acting troupes, in 1576. The existence of The Red Lion is only known through records of lawsuits initiated by John Brayne against the carpenters responsible for the construction of the playhouse in 1567 and 1569. Stephen White of University College London said the rectangular timber structure his team of researchers unearthed in Whitechapel matches the dimensions of The Red Lion recorded in the lawsuits. The postholes at the site, he added, may have supported galleried seating. Traces of other buildings at the site, including two beer cellars, and artifacts including beakers, bottles, and tankards, could have been part of The Red Lion Inn, which operated into the eighteenth century.

NISKO, POLAND— The First News reports that the remains of 115 children were found in a sixteenth-century cemetery associated with a large Catholic church in southeast Poland during road construction. Some of the children were buried with coins in their mouths. Most of them were minted during the reign of Sigismund III Vasa, who ruled Poland from 1587 to 1632, or from the reign of John II Casimir, who ruled from 1648 to 1668. “It’s certainly a sign of their beliefs,” said archaeologist Katarzyna Oleszek. “The coins are called obols of the dead or Charon’s obol. It is an old, pre-Christian tradition. But it’s been cultivated for a long time, even as late as the nineteenth century.” According to the ancient tradition, the coin was intended to be a payment or bribe to Charon, the ferryman who conveyed the dead across the river that separated the world of the living from the world of the dead. Oleszek also said that no buttons, nails, or coffin handles were recovered from the sandy soil, which suggests the children had come from a very poor community. All of the remains will eventually be reburied in a local cemetery. "

BERGEN, NORWAY— Live Science reports that the postholes of a 1,200-year-old Old Norse temple have been uncovered on the west coast of Norway by a team of researchers led by archaeologist Søren Diinhoff of the University Museum of Bergen. The Norse used such distinctive wooden temples, known as god houses, for sacrifices to the Old Norse gods at the midsummer and midwinter solstices. The structure is thought to have been used by a group of wealthy families who had contact with the Roman Empire and Germanic tribes in northern Europe. This temple measured about 45 feet long, 26 feet wide, and stood about 40 feet tall. Later god houses also had a high tower set above a pitch roof, resembling Christian basilicas built in Europe. “It would have been very impressive,” Diinhoff said. Cooking pits for preparing feasts, animal bones, and a large white stone that may have been used during fertility rituals have also been found at the site. Many god houses were destroyed in the eleventh century, when Norway’s kings established Christianity in the country. "

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK— Science Magazine reports that a team of researchers led by Eske Willerslev of the University of Cambridge and the University of Copenhagen sequenced the genomes of people who lived in Scandinavia during the Viking Age, and the genomes of people who had been buried elsewhere in Europe, including Italy, Ukraine, and Greenland, in the Viking style or with Viking grave goods, from about A.D. 750 to 1050. The study suggests that Scandinavians were more likely to have black hair than those who live in the region today, and they rarely mixed with each other. “We can separate a Norwegian person from a Swedish person from a Danish person,” explained Søren Sindbæk of Aarhus University. The researchers also found that Vikings from Norway tended to travel to Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland; Vikings from Sweden traveled to the Baltics, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine; and Vikings from Denmark headed to England. Several remains in Norway buried in the Viking style were found to have been indigenous Saami people, and no Scandinavian DNA was detected in the genomes of people buried in Viking-style graves on the Orkney Islands. But, some Vikings buried in Scandinavia had Irish and Scottish parents. “These identities aren’t genetic or ethnic, they’re social,” commented archaeologist Cat Jarman of the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo.

Matthew Jones of CR Archaeology and his team have found a flight of stairs, fragments of medieval pottery, and what may have been a fireplace or a doorway. “We have unearthed a green wine jug handle, which is Saintonage ware, and is connected with the wine trade from Gascony, France,” he explained. The original town walls were built over in the fourteenth century, when the gate was strengthened against attacks from rebels in the late thirteenth century, and rebuilt after a fire in 1326. “We have maps that show buildings and some records of names of people who lived there but very little evidence of their day to day lives,” he added.

DUBLIN, IRELAND—According to an RTÉ News report, ongoing excavations on Ship Street next to Dublin Castle have revealed centuries of the city's history, including additional remains of a previously discovered early Viking settlement. Archaeologists led by Alan Hayden of Archaeological Projects Ltd. have discovered that Dubh Linn, the ""Black Pool"" on the River Poddle from which the city derives its name, stretched more than 1,300 feet beyond its previously known extent to the dig site. The Vikings first settled on Dubh Linn, and according to historical sources, anchored up to 200 ships there. Hayden noted that this new information also explains the reference to the pool in the name of Dublin's oldest church, St. Michael le Pole, which was founded in the sixth century A.D. and whose remains lie near the excavation area. Outside the church cemetery, Hayden and his team found the burial of a man who had had his feet and hand cut off, a medieval penalty for insulting a king or lord. They also unearthed the remains of a medieval farm, twelfth-century quarries that supplied the stone used to construct the castle, and cells belonging to a police station built in 1830. "

The study found that the bones belonged to a young woman who died between the ages of 17 and 21 in the mid-seventh century A.D. An examination of her teeth indicates she ate a refined diet, and her bones show little sign of injury. Researchers plan to analyze DNA samples from the remains to try to detect any possible traces of disease or connection to a royal lineage, because tradition suggests the bones could be the remains of Eanswythe, daughter of the Anglo-Saxon king Eadbald. The princess is remembered as a devout Christian who founded England’s first nunnery after she refused to marry, and died in her late teens or early twenties, possibly of bubonic plague. Her remains were moved several times before they were hidden in the church’s wall in the sixteenth century, when the Church of England was established and the veneration of saints fell out of favor. The bones were found in the church wall in the late nineteenth century and have since been stored in a special wall niche. "

The house that once stood on the site was owned by William Pope Jr., who was also known as Squire Pope. He owned a plantation on Hilton Head Island and used his home in Bluffton, which is located further inland, as a summer residence. Some had thought any surviving traces of the house may have eroded into the May River, but Epps said that it is unlikely that Pope would have constructed his home so close to shore. “Front yards were on the riverside.

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a BBC News report, conservators uncovered a 360-year-old passageway in the House of Commons that was closed off during the Victorian era, briefly opened in the 1950s, and then sealed off and forgotten behind thick masonry and wooden paneling. Evidence for a door accessing the passageway was discovered in building plans among some 10,000 uncatalogued documents. “As we looked at the paneling closely, we realized there was a tiny brass key-hole that no one had really noticed before, believing it might just be an electricity cupboard,” said historic consultant Elizabeth Hallam Smith. The passageway was created for the coronation of Charles II in 1660, so that guests could access Westminster Hall, which is located next door. “It is the way that the Speaker’s procession would have come, on its way to the House of Commons, as well as many MPs over the centuries, so it’s a hugely historic space,” she explained. Once the door was opened, the researchers found a stone floor, the hinges for the original wooden doors that opened into Westminster Hall, nineteenth-century graffiti left behind by the workers who enclosed the space, and an electric light switch that was probably installed in the 1950s.

The Erebus and the HMS Terror set sail from England under the command of Sir John Franklin in 1845 in search of the Northwest Passage. Franklin, his crew of 128 men, and both ships were lost in the Canadian Arctic sometime after 1848.

Fragments of the chapel suggest the 130-foot-long structure had fine masonry walls, a delicate stone vault, stained glass windows, and a black plaster floor. The researchers also recovered part of an enamel and copper sacramental bowl dated to the fourteenth century, and an image of a kneeling medieval monk that may represent St. Cuthbert. The chapel was destroyed in the 1650s following the English Civil War by Sir Arthur Hesilrige, a Puritan and parliamentarian military commander who purchased the castle after it had been seized by Parliament. “Our excavation of this huge chapel has shed additional light on the immense power and wealth of the Prince-Bishops of Durham—and has helped bolster Auckland Castle’s reputation as a fortress of great importance in the history of England,” said John Castling of the Auckland Project.

Wim Van Neer of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and Savino di Lernia of Sapienza University of Rome said up to 90 percent of the animal bones in the cave’s 10,000-year-old layers came from fish such as catfish and tilapia. Some 5,000 years later, fish accounted for only about 48 percent of the animal bones found in the rock shelter. Overall, the remains of birds and shellfish made up almost 20 percent of the food waste. The researchers suggest that the number of fish bones decreased as the number of mammal bones increased, reflecting an increasing reliance on hunting and herding, perhaps because the region was becoming more arid. Van Neer explained that people may have had to walk farther to find a good fishing hole as the climate changed. “People are opportunistic—if it is easy to get they take it,” he said. "

GHENT, BELGIUM— Live Science reports that nine walls made of human bones were discovered on the grounds of Saint Bavo’s Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, by contract archaeologists who were investigating the site ahead of construction work. Most of the bones in the structures are adult leg bones and skulls dated to the second half of the fifteenth century. Bones from other body parts, and children’s bones, were probably considered too small and fragile to be included in the walls. Archaeologist Janiek de Gryse said the structures were likely built when the churchyard was cleared to make room for new burials in the first half of the sixteenth century, and again around 1784, when historical documents indicate the cemetery stopped accepting new burials. The bones will be moved to the University of Ghent, where they will be inventoried and studied, de Gryse added. "

The cemetery dates to the time of the Great Moravian Empire, a state made up of Slavic tribes that covered the regions of what are now the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Serbia from about A.D. 830 to the turn of the century. The graves are thought to hold the remains of girls and young women from noble families. “We also found female jewelry in each of the graves, earrings crafted by granulation,” said Lukĕk Galuška of the Moravian Museum. “It is the most typical female jewelry from the era of Great Moravia. Most of them are silver and some of them are gilded.” Galuška and his colleagues plan to analyze DNA samples from the bones. "

COLOGNE, GERMANY—According to a Live Science report, archaeologist Erich Classen of the Rhineland Regional Association and his colleagues were looking for a Roman villa in western Germany when they unearthed a Soviet spy radio that had been sealed in a metal box and hidden along a path through what was the Hambach Forest, just a few miles away from a nuclear research center and military air base. Manufactured in the Soviet Union in 1987, the shortwave radio, which was still covered in factory wrapping bearing notes on dial positions in Russian script, is a model R-394KKM capable of transmitting and receiving messages over a distance of some 750 miles. “We think the radio will work if a new battery is available,” Classen said. The radio itself is labeled in English with the Roman alphabet, and was perhaps intended for use by a German or English speaker before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Classen and his team suggest the radio was never used, however, and may have been stowed away as a backup device. "

LINCOLNSHIRE, ENGLAND— The Guardian reports that a mass grave dating to the fourteenth century has been uncovered at the remote site of a medieval priory and hospital in eastern England by researchers led by Hugh Willmott of the University of Sheffield. Sample DNA tests of the remains of the four dozen men, women, and children indicate they were killed by the illness known as the Black Death. Such burials are usually found in population centers such as London, Willmott explained, while it had been previously thought that plague victims living in rural areas were buried in local parish churchyards. “But actually what this suggests is that this was a rural community that couldn’t cope, and when the Black Death arrived, the normal system for doing things broke down.” The dead had all been placed in the pit within days of each other, wrapped in shrouds and carefully laid side by side, Willmott added. “Even though it is the height of a terrible disaster, they are taking as much care as they can with the dead,” he said.

MISSOULA, MONTANA— Missoulian reports that artifacts dating back to the late nineteenth century were recovered by a team led by University of Montana archaeologist Kelly Dixon working at a construction site in downtown Missoula, in what was the city’s red-light district and home to a Chinese temple. Nikki Manning of the University of Montana explained that “Chinatowns” and red-light districts were often found in close proximity to each other in the American West because Chinese doctors were often willing to treat prostitutes when others refused. Many of the objects uncovered at the site, such as Chinese ceramics, pill vials associated with Chinese traditional medicine, oyster shells, crab claws, pig skulls, rooster bones, a Chinese lock, a pocket knife, rice bowls, and opium paraphernalia have been linked to Chinese immigrants who worked on the Transcontinental Railroad. Perfume bottles, feminine hygiene products, and cosmetic jars associated with the presence of prostitution were also recovered. “Because of the small size of the neighborhood and the amount of urban development that has occurred over the past century, this is one of the only intact archaeological sites pertaining to the red-light district and Chinese community in Missoula that we are likely to find,” Manning said.

WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to a DCist report, workers renovating the basement of a Georgetown townhouse discovered human remains thought to date to the early nineteenth century. City archaeologist Ruth Trocolli said the site may have been part of an unrecorded cemetery on the block, since other human remains have been recovered during construction projects in the past. Jerry McCoy of the D.C. Public Library said one of the graves might belong to Yarrow Mamout, who is also known as “Old Yarrow” from portraits painted by James Alexander Simpson and Charles Willson Peale. Mamout, a Muslim, was kidnapped in West Africa, enslaved in Georgetown, and won his freedom at the age of 60, when he became a successful investor. Mamout lived around the corner from the recently discovered burial site, but is known to have been interred in the garden where he prayed, which was located a few yards away from his home. “We don’t know where any of the black people in early Georgetown were buried,” added historian James H. Johnston. “There are all these other questions that this could help answer about the history of black Georgetown.” "

The Juncal ’s commander had died before it set sail, and the ship began taking on water before the storm hit. The crew threw cannon and other heavy objects overboard, but the ship was lost. Only 39 of the 300 on board survived. “Because the cargo was so valuable—it was carrying lots of ingots—the authorities had a detailed inventory,” explained Iván Negueruela of Spain’s National Museum of Underwater Archaeology. “The survivors were also questioned in-depth and their statements help us to reconstruct what happened with quite a high degree of accuracy, so we have a fairly good idea of where the ship sank.” Negueruela also said the shipwreck could offer new information on how galleons were constructed in the first half of the seventeenth century, and will serve as a training ground for the next generation of underwater archaeologists.

The pebble-sized object of swirled blue and white glass, topped with five white glass droplets, is thought to be a gaming piece from the Viking board game hnefatafl , or “king’s table.” The artifact was found as part of an ongoing excavation led by DigVentures and Durham University. The dig's lead archaeologist, David Petts of Durham University, thinks the piece might have been dropped by a Norse raider, or may have belonged to a wealthy local person who may have been influenced by Norse customs even before the attack. “The sheer quality of this piece suggests this isn’t any old gaming set,” Petts said. “Someone on the island is living an elite lifestyle.” "

The skeleton’s hands and fingers were also missing, which suggests the body had floated in the sea and was damaged by sea creatures like fish and crabs. Analysis of the man’s teeth could offer clues to his diet and his origins, de Jersey added. “”If the teeth turn out to be French or Spanish then all my theories about him being a Royal Navy sailor will just have to go out of the window,” he explained.

WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA—According to a statement released by the College of William & Mary , archaeologists led by Joe Jones of the college’s Center for Archaeological Research (WMCAR) recovered a nineteenth-century glass bottle full of nails near a brick-lined hearth ahead of road construction in eastern Virginia. The hearth had been part of Redoubt 9, one of 14 mini-forts constructed by Confederate troops between the James and York rivers. Redoubt 9 was captured by Union troops after the Battle of Williamsburg in 1862. At first, researchers thought Union troops used the bottle to hold nails while repairing the fortifications, but WMCAR researchers Oliver Mueller-Heubach and Robert Hunter think it may have been intended as a ritual item called a witch bottle. Heat from a hearth was believed to energize the nails in such a bottle to ward off evil spirits and break a witch’s spell, Jones explained. Markings on this bottle indicate it was manufactured in Pennsylvania. Jones said the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry occupied Redoubt 9 intermittently between May 1862 and August 1863, during Confederate attempts to retake the territory. A witch bottle could reflect the Pennsylvania soldiers’ fears, Jones added. "

BRISTOL, ENGLAND—New research announced by the University of Bristol has shown that Anglo-Saxons used birch bark tar, a technology previously believed to be limited to prehistoric populations. The sticky, water-resistant adhesive was used beginning in the Paleolithic period throughout Europe as a sealant and for its medical properties, but it was generally thought that birch bark tar was replaced by pine tar by the Roman period. Now a team of archaeologists has identified a lump of birch bark tar in an Anglo-Saxon child's grave dating to A.D. 440–530, and birch bark tar coating the inside of a ceramic jar from a cemetery dating to perhaps a hundred years later. The researchers suspect that in both cases the tar was being used as a medicine. "

The graves are thought to hold the remains of people who were killed in the spring of 1921 during the Tulsa Race Massacre. Rioting, shooting, and fires set in the city’s prosperous Greenwood neighborhood, which was also known as “Black Wall Street,” killed as many as 300 people, most of them black. Excavation of the anomalies by forensic archaeologists would be the only way to determine if victims of the massacre were buried at the site, Regnier explained. "

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN— The Local reports that parts of the hull of a sixteenth-century ship were uncovered in central Stockholm during a construction project. Tree ring analysis of wood samples recovered from the waterlogged soil suggests that the pine trees used to build the ship were felled in the 1590s. Archaeologist Philip Tonemar said this vessel was built during a transitional period in ship design. “There are actually no other direct examples,” he explained. The hull is thought to represent the Samson , a ship not mentioned in historic records after 1607. “When the ship was abandoned in the early 1600s, it was probably stripped of material, chopped up and left on the shore,” Tonemar said. Household garbage and items, such as coins, glass, ceramics, and a small clay ball, were found on top of the vessel, he added. "

The research team members also lifted the front part of the ship, which still bears draft marks cut into the wood to show how deep the vessel sat in the water. HMS Invincible was built in France in 1744, captured by the British in the first Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1747, and ran aground and sank in 1758, but only after its lower, sleeker design influenced the shape of future Royal Navy vessels.

State Archaeologist Nicholas Bellantoni noted the men’s robust skeletons, and the haphazard condition of their shallow graves. He thinks they may have been soldiers who fought in the Battle of Ridgefield on April 27, 1777. Historic records indicate that 16 British soldiers and eight Americans were buried near the battlefield. “Their femur bones show that they clearly walked a lot and carried a lot of weight back in their day,” he explained. Bellantoni and his colleagues also recovered five buttons. “They were all linear, pressed onto one of the men’s chest area,” he said. “That suggests he was wearing a jacket at the time of the burial.” No traces of boots or weapons have been found, however. Analysis of the buttons and the men’s bones and teeth could offer more information about who they were. "

Mauri Kiudsoo of Tallinn University said the grave had been damaged by plowing, but archaeologists were able to recover fragments of spearheads, bridles, scythes, and single-edged combat knives, in addition to a crossbow-shaped brooch with poppy heads that had been damaged by fire and disfigured with spring scissors, which were also recovered from the grave. “It cannot be claimed absolutely, but it is likely the two cenotaphs are dedicated to Rävala warriors who perished in one or two battles or campaigns far from home,” Kiudsoo said. It had been previously suggested that the monuments commemorated the deaths of Scandinavian warriors. Although the same types of swords were used by people living across the Baltic Sea region, jewelry was crafted in local styles. “Crossbow-shaped brooches were usually worn by warriors from southwestern Finland and northwestern Estonia,” Kiudsoo explained. The construction style of the grave also indicates it was dug by Rävala residents. "

The ship was part of Germany’s East Asia Squadron, which mainly operated in the Pacific Ocean before the outbreak of World War I. On November 1, 1914, the Scharnhorst participated in the Battle of Coronel, which resulted in the loss of more than 1,600 British sailors and two British ships off the coast of Chile. As a result, the British Royal Navy dispatched additional ships to the South Atlantic and pursued the German squadron, ultimately sinking the Scharnhorst on December 8, 1914, with more than 800 men on board, including German Vice-Admiral Maximilian Graf von Spee and his two sons.

Researcher John-Mark Philo was looking for translations of works written by the Roman historian Tacitus when he found the manuscript, which was written on a kind of paper stock favored by the Tudor queen. He identified it through a watermark including a rampant lion, the initials “G.B.,” and a crossbow countermark present on paper used for her known translations and personal correspondence. The script of the newly identified translation is a match for the elegant handwriting of one of the queen’s known secretaries in the mid-1590s, but the corrections are in the queen’s own notoriously messy handwriting, Philo said. He added that the subject matter focuses on the death of Augustus, the rise of Tiberius, and the centralization of governmental powers in a single ruler. "

The studio was identified in 2015 with the discovery of a glass cover plate, a brass photograph preserver, a brass photograph mat, and bottles that held chemicals. Nine brass stencil plates, used with ink and a brush to label clothing and personal items, were also found at the site. “The portraits and the identifying stencils were important to the men to illustrate their status as both men and soldiers at that moment, but also for posterity, as they could soon be wounded or killed,” McBride said. He thinks the soldiers may have darkened their hair with dye before being photographed so that it would not appear white or gray in the finished black-and-white images. “We found a lot of them,” McBride said of the hair dye bottles. “It’s something you just don’t find on other sites.” "

The researchers deciphered 70 soldiers’ names, and were able to identify 30 of them through genealogy resources and U.S. military records. Many of the men who left their names on the wall belonged to the 99th and 106th Infantry Divisions, and went on to fight in the Battle of the Bulge on the Western Front later that December. As many as two million American soldiers passed through Southampton on the trek to mainland Europe. "

Originally constructed in the early sixteenth century, the Sedlec Ossuary is a subterranean chapel where the bones of an estimated 40,000 to 70,000 medieval people were arranged as decorations and furnishings, including a chandelier, a coat of arms, and four large mounds. Archaeologist Jan Frolik said that the newly discovered graves hold the remains of people who died during a famine in 1318 and the plague in 1348. “So when the ossuary was built, they had no idea that the graves were there,” he explained. So far, researchers studying the bones have found an even ratio of adults to children, but 30 percent more adult men than women. Frolik and his colleagues suggest that men came to Kutná Hora to work as miners and lost their lives there during the dangerous work. “Otherwise I would say it was a typical medieval society, judging by the injuries and illnesses reflected in the bones,” he said.

GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA—Oyster eaters have been avoiding the shellfish during the summer months—thereby lowering their risk of food poisoning—for at least 4,000 years, according to an announcement released by The Florida Museum of Natural History . Researchers Nicole Cannarozzi and Michal Kowalewski looked for evidence of Boonea impressa , a parasitic snail that latches onto oyster shells, in a 230-foot shell ring built by the inhabitants of St. Catherines Island off the coast of Georgia. The snail has a predictable 12-month life cycle, and so by measuring the length of its shell, the scientists were able to estimate when its oyster host had been harvested by humans. The size of the snail shells on the oyster shells in the ring indicate the oyster harvest was limited to the late fall, winter, and spring. Cannarozzi pointed out that the harvest avoided not only the summer months, but the time when southeastern oysters spawned as well."

However, a clay pipe recovered at the site was only manufactured between 1803 and 1815, Waite explained. The excavation also uncovered a decorated button manufactured in the early 1800s. Built in the standard design of the British Army, the field kitchen had 12 stone-lined hearths and would have produced food for 120 soldiers. As many as 3,000 British, Prussian, and Dutch soldiers are thought to have been garrisoned on the island, which is located in the English Channel, in preparation for a possible Napoleonic invasion from France. The mound also contained golf balls, a lead weight from an old wooden golf driver, and World War II-era ammunition cartridges manufactured in Leipzig, Germany.

Archaeologist Franc Myles said the church, known as St. Andrew’s, was built in 1709, at a time when so-called Penal Laws restricted the religious, political, and economic activities of Roman Catholics and Protestant dissenters from the Church of Ireland. Thousands of worshippers attended Roman Catholic services in the structure, however. An inscribed foundation stone was laid in 1814 for the construction of a new chapel for the growing parish, but the project was abandoned in 1831, when a newly appointed priest decided to move the church to a more central location. Myles said that no graveyard had been attached to the church, and so his team does not expect to uncover any human remains during the excavation. Much of the church structure and seventeenth-century features are thought to have been destroyed when the housing development was constructed in the 1960s, he added. "

Thomas and her colleagues analyzed mitochondrial genetic data obtained from the remains of 41 great auks, ocean current data, and the probability of auk populations going extinct within a certain amount of time in order to reconstruct bird populations over the past 11,700 years. The study results indicate that the industrial-scale pressure humans put on bird populations beginning in the early sixteenth century were probably enough to wipe them out, even if environmental changes did not put them at risk.

The original burial dates to the eighth century A.D. and consists of a boat measuring nearly 32 feet long, in which the remains of a man and weapons were found. Some 100 years later, this burial was carefully excavated, and the remains of a woman were placed in a boat measuring about 26 feet long, which was then carefully fitted into the older, larger vessel.

In addition, a corroded metal nail recovered from the shipwreck was examined using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy at Samara Polytech and atomic emission spectroscopy at Samara University, and found to consist of nearly pure iron, which is consistent with a medieval date for the vessel.

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN—According to a report in The Guardian , two shipwrecks thought to be seventeenth-century warships have been found in the Swedish archipelago in a strait that leads to Stockholm. One of the vessels may be the sister ship of the Vasa , which was built between 1626 and 1628, equipped with 64 cannon, and capsized and sank on its maiden voyage in the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea, just outside Stockholm’s harbor. The Vasa ’s well-preserved hull is now on display in Stockholm’s Vasa Museum. Maritime archaeologist Patrik Höglund said three other ships built by the same shipwright— Applet , Kronan , and Scepter —may have been deliberately sunk in the same area after they were decommissioned from the Swedish navy. Wood samples from the wrecks will be dated and analyzed. “Then we can even see where the timber has been cut down and then we can go back and look in the archives and I think we have good chances to tell exactly which ship this is,” added maritime archaeologist Jim Hansson.

Known as a vervel, the small ring, which measures less than one-half inch in diameter and is engraved with the name Thomas Playters, was discovered in a field in southeastern England by a metal detectorist last year. Sophie Flynn of the Colchester Museum said the vervel’s rounded interior surface would have caused minimal discomfort and reduced chance of injury to the bird. “The size and style of lettering suggests the vervel dates to the 1600s,” she added.

BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND—After a decade of research, archaeologists led by Chris Fern of the University of York think that the seventh-century A.D. gold and garnet artifacts known as the Staffordshire Hoard were captured by the armies of Mercia’s King Penda from his rivals in Northumbria and East Anglia, according to a report in The Guardian . Although almost 80 percent of the identified objects are fittings from weapons, a large processional cross in the collection suggests Anglo-Saxons may have carried Christian items into battle. The scholars have also identified a unique gold and garnet artifact as an ornament worn on top of a bishop’s headpiece. Both of these items had been bent before they were buried. It had been previously thought that gold weapons were limited to Anglo-Saxon kings, but a class of elite warriors may have wielded the 50 gold sword pommels found in the hoard. King Penda, who died in A.D. 655, is known to have defeated and killed the East Anglian kings Sigeberht and Anna, successors of Raedwald, who is thought to have been the occupant of the Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo, which was discovered in 1939. Perhaps King Penda seized some of this treasure from their stores, Fern said. "

The images include horses, a bicycle, two plows, names, and initials. Historic environment officer Ian Marshman of Lincolnshire County Council said a past owner of the farm was able to help researchers identify the two youngsters who carved the pictures and trace what happened to their families during the war. The first, William Bristow, was the youngest son of the family who owned the farm. He remained in England and produced food vital to the war effort. The second, John Leusley, was the eldest son of the landlord of the nearby pub. He was injured during military service in France. Leusley’s brother Richard was killed in action in 1918 at the age of 21. His brother William was awarded the Military Medal for “gallantry and devotion to duty under fire.” The door will be preserved by descendants of the Bristow family, Marshman added. "

The submarine is thought to have held enough oxygen to keep the crew alive for about two hours before it would need to be replenished by either rising to the surface and opening the hatches, or activating the submarine’s stealth air circulation system, which was comprised of a rubber hose connected to snorkel tubes and hand-pumped bellows. Scafuri said the snorkel tubes, however, were found in the lowered position, and the rest of the system had been disconnected and tucked underneath the submarine’s crew bench. Union ships are likely to have been in Charleston Harbor, making rising to the surface a dangerous proposition, he explained. The researchers are also trying to determine if the now highly corroded air system had been working properly. "

The wreckage was found by a team of researchers from Vulcan Inc., a company founded by the late philanthropist Paul Allen. The Fletcher-class destroyer, which bore the hull number DD-557, sank during the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944, when four Japanese battleships surprised the Johnston and other U.S. ships supporting troop landings as part of the invasion of the island of Leyte. Only 141 men of the Johnston ’s crew of 327 survived the battle. The wreckage includes unidentifiable pieces of twisted metal, a destroyed gun deck, and a propeller shaft. Robert Neyland of the Naval History and Heritage Command’s Underwater Archaeology Branch said the team members would need to find a portion of the hull bearing the Johnston ’s identification number or name, or personal effects of the crew, to identify the ship, since another Fletcher-class destroyer, the USS Hoel (DD-533), was also in the area at the time of the battle. “There was a lot of confusion in that battle,” Neyland explained.

The so-called ""torpedo"" bottle is of a type that came into use in the 1830s, primarily as a vessel for carbonated beverages. It contains fishhooks, human teeth, glass fragments, and an undetermined liquid, and is a late example of a centuries-old folk magic tradition used to ward off harmful spells and curses. More than a hundred witch bottles, most of which date to the seventeenth century, have been unearthed at archaeological sites or found hidden in historic structures across Britain. The find adds another magical chapter to the history of the pub, once called the Star and Garter Inn, which is also recorded to have been the birthplace of an accused witch named Angeline Tubbs around 1761. Tubbs emigrated to North America as a teenager, settling in Saratoga Springs, New York, where she is said to have been a fortune teller and is still the subject of ghost tours. "

When archaeologist Jon Hoyle of the Gloucestershire City Council Archaeological Service first spotted the circular feature in the results of the lidar survey, he thought it might be a World War II–era gun emplacement. But after visiting the site, which is near the village of Tidenham, he determined that it actually dated to between 2500 and 1500 B.C. The ring cairn consists of a circular bank measuring some 16 feet wide and 80 feet in diameter. It includes at least 10 white standing stones, each at most three feet tall. “Nobody knows precisely what [ring cairns] were used for,” said Hoyle. “Some have been found in association with burials, and often there appear to be residues of charcoal in places like this, suggesting rituals that involved fire.” He added that this is the first such structure to have been found in Gloucestershire.

YORK, ENGLAND—Art historian Christopher Norton of the University of York has suggested that the Bayeux Tapestry was commissioned within a few years of the Norman conquest of England in A.D. 1066 to hang in France’s Bayeux Cathedral, according to a Live Science report. Images on the artwork, which is thought to have been commissioned by Bishop Odo, a half-brother of William the Conqueror, and stitched by women in England, depict the exploits of the first Norman king of England and his victory at the Battle of Hastings. Norton examined documentary evidence, surviving architectural details of the church, published data on the tapestry’s measurements, and information on medieval cloth sizes. He says the physical and narrative structure of the 230-foot-long tapestry’s embroidered linen strips are perfectly adapted to the north, south, and west sides of the cathedral’s main, central section, allowing for the church’s choir screen, doorways, and architectural supports, and shrinkage and missing sections of the tapestry.

Rebecca Crozier of the University of Aberdeen said the bones came from five to seven people, two of whom were children between the ages of two and seven. “In the case of the child, we were able to tell that a hole had been drilled into the skull and I was able to match it to a particular tool,” Crozier said. A similar hole was found in the skull of an adult. In both cases, the procedure occurred after the person’s death. Carbon dating indicates the bones belonged to people who lived between 1650 and 1750. The Anatomy Act, passed in the United Kingdom in 1832, was intended to halt grave robbing and the illegal trade in corpses by regulating the study of donated human bodies. Aberdeenshire Council archaeologist Bruce Mann said Creyk and his colleagues may have buried the remains on the property to avoid legal troubles. The bones will be reburied in a cemetery close to where they were found, he added. "

The stonework may have served as building foundations, or as walkways described in medieval sources for watchmen to patrol the city and the port’s jetties, Hegdal said. Timber quay structures have also been found some 300 feet to the north, he added, suggesting the quay at the port of Oslo was larger than had been previously thought. The newly uncovered landing area, however, is larger and better built, leading Hegdal to speculate that the area might have once been one of higher status.

The team members analyzed clam shells found in middens at five coastal archaeological sites, and found that the shellfish were first harvested some 9,000 years ago. Shells dating to some 3,500 years ago grew larger, Toniello explained, when indigenous people began to construct rock-walled terraces in intertidal zones. Maintenance of these “clam gardens” helped to optimize and preserve clam habitats while protecting bivalves from non-human predators. The gardens also produced plentiful crabs, sea cucumbers, and seaweeds. Traditional clam gardens declined after the arrival of Europeans and the introduction of industrial harvesting methods, Toniello added. "

Archaeologist Tore Slinning of Hordaland County Council thinks the weapon, once attached to a wooden arrow, was lost in the snow during a reindeer hunt about 1,000 years ago, during the end of the Viking age or the early medieval period. “We don’t know when the long arrow would have decomposed,” Slinning said. “The arrow may have rotted away a long time ago if it was in soil. If it had been encased in snow and ice, it may have decomposed much more recently when the snow had melted.” Villagers living near the area where the arrowhead was found are known to have extracted iron ore from the land, he added, although such finds are not common in the region because they are easily crushed by moving glaciers. The arrowhead will be conserved at the University Museum in Bergen. "

Coins uncovered at the site suggest the drove road that passed the pub had been in use since the late sixteenth century. Bailie said the pub’s double chimneys, slate roof, and lime-washed walls reflected the “modernity and affluence” that had been growing in the region in the mid-seventeenth century, since drovers’ inns were usually drystone structures with wooden shutters, low walls, central hearths, and thatched roofs. The excavation revealed the remains of meals of rabbit, birds, fish, and whelks, and shards of drinking glasses. An inverted cross found on a hearth stone may have been intended to keep witches from flying down the chimney, Bailie added. The pub fell out of use by 1819, however, due to the Highland Clearances, in which landowners evicted their tenants in order to enclose their fields for more profitable large-scale sheep herding. "

JENA, GERMANY—An international team of researchers led by Mark Hudson of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History suggests that fish may have been raised for food in China as early as 6200 B.C. The scientists analyzed and compared carp teeth unearthed at Jiahu, a Neolithic site in central China, with remains of fish unearthed at other archaeological sites, and fish raised in modern fish farms in Japan. In earlier periods at Jiahu, when fish were caught in the wild during the spawning season, the catch consisted of adult fish, the researchers explained, but beginning around 6200 B.C., both mature and immature fish were processed at the site. Hudson and his colleagues think the early farmers began to keep some of the wild-caught carp alive in confined spaces, such as rice paddy fields, where they continued to spawn. When the water was drained, both the mature and immature fish were harvested. The high proportion of bones at Jiahu from a type of carp found less commonly in the wild is also evidence for the practice of aquaculture, the researchers added, indicating that the fish farmers kept their preferred variety.

The 1788 Excise Act banned the use of stills producing less than 100 gallons of whiskey at a time, but legal whiskey was often of poor quality, since the large distilleries tended to use raw unmalted grain in order to avoid paying the heavy tax imposed on malted grain. Ritchie said grain could have been malted in the remote corn drying kilns, fermented and distilled in the long narrow buildings, and smuggled southward where it would have sold for a higher price than the inferior legal product.

HALLE, GERMANY—According to a report in The Art Newspaper , conservators have determined that a fragment of a painted wooden warrior’s shield discovered in a Germanic chief’s tomb in central Germany is 1,700 years old. Conservator Christian-Heinrich Wunderlich of the Landesmuseum in Halle said microscopic examination of the wood fragment revealed that the surface had been prepared with chalk and lime to create a smooth surface for layers of paint such as “Egyptian blue,” which was widely available in the Roman Empire, and vermillion, which was only available in a few places in the Mediterranean. “These pigments were not cheap and must have been Roman imports,” Wunderlich said. The shield would have measured about four feet across, and was probably painted on both sides, he added. The chief’s tomb also contained a gold neck ring and brooch, silver belts, spurs, a knife, coins, arrowheads, drinking glasses, a bronze vessel for mixing wine, and a bronze stool. Wunderlich explained that some of these objects may have been received as payment from the Romans for acting as a mercenary or conducting a looting expedition, while other items are thought to have been made in Scandinavia.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/8015-190918-iceland-walrus-extinction,Medieval,"Tests Indicate Iceland's Walruses Disappeared After Viking Arrival. COPENHAGEN, DENMARK— Morten Tange Olsen and Xénia Keighley of the University of Copenhagen radiocarbon dated the remains of 34 walruses recovered in western Iceland in an effort to learn if the island’s unique subspecies died out after the establishment of a permanent Viking settlement around A.D. 874, according to a New Scientist report. The study suggests that three of these animals lived during the Viking period, with the latest death occurring sometime between 1213 and 1330. It had been previously suggested that the walrus hunt described in a twelfth-century Icelandic saga, and the walrus skull and tusks sent to Canterbury to commemorate the death of Thomas Becket in 1170, may have involved animals that lived somewhere other than Iceland. The new dates suggest, however, that these animals could have been locals. In addition, to test the idea that the Icelandic walrus population simply left the island after the establishment of the Viking settlement and joined another walrus community, Olsen and Keighley’s team analyzed mitochondrial DNA obtained from the bones. They found that the Icelandic walrus subspecies is genetically distinct from walrus communities now living in other areas of the North Atlantic. “That was highly surprising,” Olsen said. "

IPPLEPEN, ENGLAND—Archaeologists led by Stephen Rippon of the University of Exeter have unearthed a fourth-century A.D. butcher’s shop and possible craft center in the acidic soil of southwest England, according to a report in The Guardian . The discovery supports the idea that Roman influence stretched at least 20 miles further southwest than had been previously thought. Rippon said the abattoir likely belonged to butchers who produced high quality cuts of meat, since his team found just the heads and hooves of young cattle. Nothing would have been found, he explained, if peasant farmers had butchered their worn-out oxen. “They would have boiled down the bits that have been thrown away and made something like brawn [headcheese] out of them,” Rippon said. The fine cuts of meat could have then been stored in barrels of salted water and transported on the nearby Roman road to market. Goods such as awls, needles, combs, and hairpins made of deer antler, and perhaps even leather and textiles, are also thought to have been carried from the site, along with items crafted at a nearby blacksmith’s forge. “This all builds up a picture of Ipplepen as a settlement that is not a normal farming community but a place where craftsmen are making all sorts of things,” Rippon said.

MODENA, ITALY—New analysis of the tooth enamel of two individuals, buried with their hands interlocked in a fifth-century A.D. necropolis, has revealed that both were men, according to a Live Science report. When the burial was discovered in northern Italy in 2009, mass media outlets assumed the individuals—dubbed the ""Lovers of Modena""—were a man and a woman, though the badly preserved skeletons precluded a definitive determination of sex. However, Federico Lugli of the University of Bologna and his colleagues have found that both individuals' tooth enamel contained amelogenin isoform Y, a protein that is only present in the enamel of males. Based on this finding, the researchers suggest the burial represents an expression of commitment between the pair. While they cannot rule out a romantic relationship between the men, they noted that negative attitudes toward same-sex relationships in Late Antique Italy, as well as Christian religious restrictions in place at the time, make it unlikely those responsible for their burial positioning would have intentionally depicted such a connection. Other skeletons interred in the same cemetery show evidence of injury, perhaps indicating the necropolis was a war cemetery. If that is the case, the researchers added, the men may have been comrades or relatives who were killed during a skirmish. "

Many Irish laborers were thought to have subsisted on a diet of potatoes and milk, supplemented with eggs and wheat when possible. Researchers led by Jonny Geber of the University of Edinburgh found evidence of a diet based on corn, with some oats, wheat, and milk, in the calcified plaque from the teeth of most of the individuals buried at the workhouse. Traces of egg protein were detected in the plaque of just three people. Geber explained that Ireland imported corn, known as Indian meal, from the United States as a relief food for the starving. "

The site was home to a church that opened in 1834, but the 600 headstones in the church’s cemetery were removed by 1898. The analysis indicates that the two men and two women ranged in age from 35 to 60. Their bones show signs of heavy labor, and the condition of their teeth indicates they bit down on ceramic pipes to smoke tobacco. “It really brings home vividly the difficulty of life back then,” said former Connecticut state archaeologist Nicholas Bellantoni. “You could see the stress on their bodies—lives were short and painful.” DNA testing suggests three of the people were of Central and Southern European descent, and may have been members of the small Prussian, Polish, German, or Italian populations that lived in New Haven at the time. The fourth body had fractured neck vertebrae. The researchers suggest the remains may have belonged to James McCaffrey, an Irish immigrant who was convicted of murder, hanged, and buried in the church cemetery in 1850. "

The woman was buried in a wooden coffin about 5 feet below the ground. Lucie Horáková of the Museum of Romani Culture said the bones may belong to a Romani victim of the camp, and could mark the location of mass graves. “It is now necessary to perform an analysis of the DNA in order to determine with certainty whether or not these remains belong to a camp victim,” she said. Historic records indicate that some 1,300 Romani men, women, and children were held at the camp between August 1942 and May 1943. More than 300 prisoners died at the camp, while more than 500 were sent to Auschwitz. As many as 90 percent of the Roma living in Bohemia and Moravia are thought to have been killed by the Nazis. "

The grave is one of nine burial pits found in Yaroslavl, a city located at the confluence of the Volga and Kotorosl Rivers, where more than 300 massacred residents were interred after an attack by Mongol soldiers under the command of Batu Khan in A.D. 1238. A team of scientists from the Institute of Archaeology at the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology decided to test these three skeletons, discovered at the site of what may have been a wealthy estate burned down during the attack, because they shared certain skull features, in addition to signs of spina bifida—a hereditary birth defect that affects the spinal cord. Asya Engovatova, director of excavations at Yaroslavi, said the three individuals also suffered from more advanced tooth decay than many of the other remains found in the city’s burial pits, indicating they may have eaten more honey and sugar, befitting their status. A fourth individual who was buried in a nearby grave may have also been a maternal relative, she added. "

The prince was buried in a wooden sarcophagus placed in an underground chamber made of logs. Although the burial was looted in antiquity, the remains—in addition to the wood, leather, and textile artifacts—were preserved by the tomb’s microclimate. Karol Pieta of the Slovak Academy of Sciences said analysis of the remains suggests the man died around the age of 20, probably of Hepatitis B. The testing also indicates he grew up near the Tatras Mountains, where he was buried. But Pieta said the young man spent a significant part of his life in the Mediterranean region. “We know it thanks to isotope analysis that revealed his eating habits, and those are Mediterranean,” he said. “It is possible that he was part of an imperial Roman court or served in the Roman army as a prominent officer.” "

Radosław Karasiewicz-Szczypiorski of the University of Warsaw, who works with Shota Mamuladze of the Gonio-Apsaros Museum-Reserve, said the room where the mosaic was found may have served as a bedroom, since it is located deep within the villa structure. The mosaic was originally laid over a hypocaust, or under-floor heating system. The recovered tiles, in green, black, white, red, and yellow, fell into the hypocaust when the floor collapsed, and are thought to have formed a decorative motif, but not enough of the design survives to determine what it was. “Floor mosaics were uncommon in military structures built by the ancient Romans,” Karasiewicz-Szczypiorski explained, although a well-preserved mosaic floor featuring a geometric design was found in the adjacent room during earlier excavations.

Such conch shells were used to make wampum, and arrived in New Jersey as ballast on ships from the Caribbean. Historic records suggest the home where the shells were discovered was once owned by people who worked at the Campbell Wampum Mill, which was located about two miles away. The Campbell Wampum Mill used machines to mass produce shell beads and hair pipes, which were won by Native Americans at important ceremonies, as late as 1890. Earlier archaeological investigations in the region failed to find any evidence of wampum-making. “This is the smoking gun archaeological signature we have been searching for all summer,” said Eric Johnson of Harvard University. Finished wampum was sold to New York merchants, who traded with Native Americans. Evidence of a workshop was uncovered at the site of the residence, based on the large quantities of shell pieces recovered. "

The artifacts include musket balls, pistol shot, horse harness fittings, belt buckles, a powder container cap, a musket trigger guard, and a piece of metal that may have been the cross hilt of a sword. The opening skirmish of the war, fought by Royalists and Parliamentarians, took place on horseback to the north of Powick Bridge in 1642. On September 3, 1651, King Charles II was defeated by Oliver Cromwell in a battle that occurred to the south of the same bridge. The king escaped, however, and fled to Europe, where he lived in exile until he was restored to the throne in 1660. Lead archaeologist Richard Bradley said the distribution of the artifacts, such as pistol shots fired by the cavalry and musket shots fired by infantry, reflect the different troops that had been fighting in the last battle, and indicate that it took place even further south than previously thought. “Many of the lead musket and pistol balls show evidence of firing or impact and these tangible signs of the conflict offer a poignant connection to the soldiers who fought and died here,” he explained.

The tunnel is thought to have been dug in the sixteenth century A.D. in order to loot the ancient tower tomb, which was hidden within Bulgaria’s Maltepe Burial Mound. Once inside the structure, the Ottoman-era looters dug a pit about eight feet deep, which they then refilled, Kisyov said. They then attempted to dig upward into the tower, he added. The diggers left behind a coin minted during the reign of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520–1566), two earlier coins, a metal bridle bit, and draft-animal droppings. Burn marks on the tunnel’s ceiling indicate the diggers carried torches or lamps. Scholars speculate the tomb may contain the remains of the Roman emperor Philip I the Arab, who ruled from A.D. 244 to 249. “However, I don’t rule out the possibility that an Odrysian aristocrat might be buried in it, such as Teres, who was a proxy for the emperor, and governed the entire Roman province of Thracia,” Kisyov said.

Archaeological evidence suggests the population of Jōmon hunter-gatherers declined some 3,000 years ago, at a time when global temperatures and sea levels dropped. The researchers found a corresponding decrease in the number of different ancestral Y-chromosome sequences. During such a drop in the population, one particular DNA sequence may have become more common, which would explain why it makes up more than 35 percent of the Y chromosomes of ethnically Japanese men today, Ohashi explained. Japan’s population rebounded and increased some 2,500 years ago with the arrival of Yayoi farmers from the Korea Peninsula, who mixed with the surviving Jōmon hunter-gatherers, he added. "

BOULDER, COLORADO—According to a report by The Denver Channel , Paola Villa of the University of Colorado Boulder and her colleagues detected residues of adhesives on 10 of more than 1,000 stone tools recovered from two caves on the coast of western Italy. The tools, dated to between 40,000 and 55,000 years ago, were crafted by Neanderthals. Analysis of the adhesive suggests Neanderthals used pine resin or a mixture of pine resin and beeswax to haft the tools to wooden or bone handles, Villa explained. Because pine resin solidifies when exposed to air, the mixture was probably made over a fire, she added. "

SVISHTOV, BULGARIA— Archaeology in Bulgaria reports that the head from a small statue of a child dating to the third century A.D. and a chamber pot were unearthed at the site of the ancient city of Novae during excavations led by Pavlina Vladkova of the Veliko Tarnovo Regional Museum of History. Two other carvings similar to the head have been previously found at the site, and are thought to have been part of statues depicting playing children, Vladkova said. The chamber pot measures nearly two feet deep, has a stable bottom, and was found in a Roman villa, in an area where the bedrooms are thought to have been located. Three other chamber pots have been recovered from the structure, but this one is smaller, Vladkova explained, and may have been used by children. A latrine at the villa was connected to several canals with a pipeline, she added. The city of Novae was founded as a Roman military camp at the southernmost point of the Danube River in A.D. 69, and was occupied into the seventh century, when it was destroyed by invading Avars and Slavs. "

LEICESTER, ENGLAND—Excavations at the site of the ruins of brick buildings of Bradgate House, which is located in the East Midlands, have uncovered stone structures that archaeologists say may have been the foundations of the home of Lady Jane Grey, according to a Leicestershire Live report. Jane, a Protestant great-granddaughter of Henry VII, succeeded Edward VI to the throne under the terms of his will. She was queen of England for nine days in 1553, but she lost the support of the Privy Council of England and was deposed and eventually executed by Roman Catholic Mary Tudor. The first structures at Bradgate House were built in 1520 by Thomas Grey, second marquis of Dorset. Lady Jane Grey is thought to have been born there in 1537. “Our evidence suggests that the home Lady Jane Grey would have recognized may have looked very different from what we see today,” said Richard Thomas of the University of Leicester. “We will be trying to date their construction and when they were demolished to make way for the current structures.” "

LEIPZIG, GERMANY—According to a CNN report, researchers led by Kay Prüfer of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology have sequenced the genomes of two Neanderthals who lived in Western Europe about 120,000 years ago. One of the genomes was obtained from the jawbone of a young female Neanderthal, discovered in Belgium’s Scladina Cave in 1993, and the other was extracted from the femur of a male Neanderthal found in Germany’s Hohlenstein-Stadel Cave in 1937. The study suggests these two individuals were closely related to Neanderthals who lived in Western Europe just 40,000 years ago, around when the species is thought to have died out. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from the male Neanderthal also revealed more than 70 mutations not found in later Neanderthal individuals. This unusual mitochondrial DNA could have been inherited from an unknown population that may have been related to modern humans, added Prüfer’s colleague, Stéphane Peyrégne. Some early Neanderthals are thought to have migrated to Siberia from Western Europe, only to have been replaced by a later migrant population. The study also suggests that the later population living in Western Europe was more closely related to their ancestors than to their contemporaries in Siberia. "

Some 50,000 people were expected to attend the three-day festival, but more than 400,000 arrived and camped on the property to listen to 32 musical acts, including Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, The Who, and Jimi Hendrix. Archaeologist Maria O’Donovan of Binghamton University said the recent survey revealed stacked stones that marked the placement of the booths, where people gathered to sell, trade, and barter goods, in an arrangement that is inconsistent with a 1969 map of the site. The booths reflect how the festival took on a life of its own, O’Donovan explained, beyond what was planned by its organizers.

OSLO, NORWAY—According to a Science Nordic report, Marianne Moen of the University of Oslo examined the contents of more than 200 Viking graves in southeastern Norway, and found that elite Viking men and women may not have had clearly differentiated gender roles, since they were often buried with the same types of artifacts, including cooking equipment, jewelry, and keys. “The key is a good example. It is often considered to be the symbol of a housewife,” Moen said, though keys were discovered in almost as many men's graves as women's graves. Moen suggests cooking equipment, which is often interpreted as a sign of housekeeping, was included in the graves as a symbol of hospitality. Critics of this idea counter that men would have probably cooked for themselves while on long sea voyages, but may not have done so while at home. "

PARIS, FRANCE— Live Science reports that Philippe Charlier of the Musée du quai Branly-Jacques-Chirac and his colleagues examined a medieval jawbone that was buried in Notre Dame Cathedral and said to belong to Louis IX, also known as St. Louis, who was king of France during the Eighth Crusade. The researchers found that the jawbone’s owner suffered from a severe case of scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency and characterized by gum disease, loss of teeth, anemia, and a weakened immune system. Charlier said the jawbone had the right shape to have belonged to a 56-year-old man—Louis’ age at death—and resembled sculpturesof the king in the cathedral. Louis died in 1270 while besieging Tunis, where he ate a diet comprised mostly of fish, which is low in vitamin C. Medieval chronicler Jean de Joinville wrote that the soldiers in Louis’ army suffered from gum necrosis, and barbers had to cut the dead tissue out of their mouths. Radiocarbon dating of the jawbone indicated its owner died between A.D. 1030 and 1220, but the king’s low-carbon fish diet may have skewed the results, potentially making the bone seem older than it really is, the researchers explained.

The project revealed that the town spilled out beyond the boundary of its walls. “It’s really remarkable to see the Visigothic monarchy coming together at this time and assembling the resources to be able to found a new city,” McCormick said. At the time, volcanic eruptions had brought on what is known as the Late Antique Little Ice Age, a period usually associated with imperial collapse, famine, mass migrations, and an outbreak of bubonic plague. One large building identified during the survey is oriented toward Mecca, and its floor plan resembles that of mosques in the Middle East, McCormick added.

The teeth were recovered from a wooden drain in the sewer system. “There was no dentist as such in St. John’s until fairly late in the nineteenth century,” said archaeologist Blair Temple of Gerald Penney Associates. He thinks the teeth were probably pulled by a barber or pharmacist who washed them down a drain. The teeth then got caught in a drain that had been choked up with silt, he explained. A dentist confirmed most of the teeth had bad cavities and tobacco stains, and had been pulled from different people. The other items recovered during the excavation include an intact glass bottle, the copper finial from the end of an umbrella, pipe fragments, pieces of dinnerware, and a burned copper egg cup fused to pieces of mortar and glass.

The building’s walls collapsed over the floors, Ewen explained, preserving pipes that had never been smoked, liquor bottles, and unidentified iron tools. Other artifacts recovered at the site include the brass tap from a wine barrel, broken mugs and goblets, an Irish half-penny dated to 1766, thimbles, straight pins, and women’s clothing fasteners. “Taverns really were one of the most important structures in a colonial town,” said Jim McKee, the site manager of Brunswick Town/Ft.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7698-190605-bulgaria-culverin-cannonballs,Medieval,"Medieval Ammunition Unearthed in Bulgaria. SVISHTOV, BULGARIA— Archaeology in Bulgaria reports that an excavation conducted by Nikolay Ovcharov of Bulgaria’s National Institute and Museum of Archaeology unearthed a collection of small cannonballs at the well-preserved site of Zishtova Fortress, on the Danube River in northern Bulgaria. The cannonballs are thought to have been ammunition for a medieval form of cannon known as a culverin. They may have been fired in 1461, when the Ottoman-held fortress was conquered by Vlad the Impaler, who ruled Wallachia, a region between the Danube and the Carpathian Mountains. “We rejoice at those small cannonballs because they are from culverins,” Ovcharov said. Since the weapons were only used from the fifteenth to the sixteenth centuries, he added, this means the cannonballs likely date to Vlad the Impaler's time. Zishtova Fortress was in use until 1810, when it was burned by Russian troops during one of the Russian-Turkish Wars. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7697-190604-china-neolithic-brewing,Neolithic,"Two Types of Brewing Detected in China’s Neolithic Pottery. STANFORD, CALIFORNIA— New Scientist reports that Li Liu of Stanford University and an international team of researchers found evidence of fermented starch granules on pottery sherds uncovered at two early farming sites located about 185 miles apart in north China. The pottery fragments ranged in age from 8,000 to 7,000 years old, and came from vessels that had small mouths, thin necks, and wide sides that blocked fresh air and promoted the brewing process. At the site of Lingkou, Liu said, the early farmers began the fermentation process by allowing grains to sprout, which freed up their natural sugars for fermentation. Meanwhile, at the site of Guantaoyuan, fungi, herbs, and grains were added to cereals as a “fermentation starter” known as qū. The researchers suggest the production of alcoholic beverages may have been linked to social and religious activities, thus fueling the development of agriculture. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7696-190604-east-africa-herding,Neolithic,"Herders and Hunter-Gatherers Shared Genes in East Africa. MADRID, SPAIN—It had been previously thought that the practice of herding domesticated animals may have spread across Africa through exchange networks, but Science News reports that a new genetic study of human remains unearthed in East Africa tells a different story. The researchers found that early herders, who were related to Middle Eastern pastoralists, first mixed with foragers in northeast Africa between 6,000 and 5,000 years ago. They then traveled south to the Rift Valley, where they mated with foragers there between 4,500 and 3,500 years ago. Mary Prendergast of Saint Louis University and her colleagues say that after this time, herders and foragers living in East Africa remained isolated from each other, although the herders spread rapidly throughout the region. Then, some 1,200 years ago, the study suggests that additional groups of people from northeastern and western Africa migrated into East Africa, where they produced another genetic shift that paralleled the rise of farming and ironworking.

SOFIA, BULGARIA— The Sofia Globe reports that a brick burial chamber held together with pale yellow mortar and covered with a stone slab was discovered just under the modern street level near Sofia’s Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. The tomb measures nearly seven feet long and four feet wide, and is thought to have been built in the third or fourth century A.D., based on its resemblance to other tombs in a nearby necropolis. No human remains were found in the tomb, which was damaged, likely during the construction of the square around the cathedral in the early twentieth century. Researchers from Sofia’s Regional History Museum think more tombs may be found in the area. "

TEMPE, ARIZONA—According to a report in The Independent , researchers led by David Braun of George Washington University and Christopher Campisano of Arizona State University uncovered a collection of 327 Oldowan tools dated to more than 2.58 million years ago in northeastern Ethiopia. Sediments at the site revealed that the tools, found along with animal remains, were dropped at the edge of a water source and quickly buried. “This is the first time we see people chipping off bits of stone to make tools with an end in mind,” explained Kaye Reed of Arizona State University. “They only took two or three flakes off, and some you can tell weren’t taken off quite right. The latest tools seem slightly different in the way they’re made from other examples.” The discovery suggests flaked stone tools were invented multiple times, since these examples are distinct from “percussive” tools made by other primates and earlier human ancestors that date back as early as 3.3 million years ago. After about 2.6 million years ago, at about the time when the teeth of human ancestors began to get smaller, they also became more accurate and skilled tool makers, the researchers explained. "

ABERDEENSHIRE, SCOTLAND— The Herald Scotland reports that pottery made in the carinated bowl tradition has been unearthed at Kirkton of Fetteresso, a site located near eastern Scotland’s Stonehaven Bay, and dated to between 3952 and 3766 B.C. The presence of the pottery at the site, which was occupied for at least 4,500 years, means that farming was practiced in the region more than 100 years earlier than had been thought, according to Robert Lenfert of Cameron Archaeology and his colleagues. There are only two other sites in Britain with pottery of similar style and age, and both are in the northeast as well, Lenfert explained. The researchers suggest that early farmers may have traveled directly to the region from mainland Europe by boat, rather than following major rivers, as had been previously suggested. "

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND— Cosmos Magazine reports that evidence of intestinal parasite infection has been detected in 8,000-year-old feces from Turkey’s well-preserved Neolithic village of Çatalhöyük. Archaeologist Piers Mitchell of Cambridge University and his colleagues think the residents may have relieved themselves in the midden, where the coprolites, or fossilized feces were found, or in clay pots inside their homes, and then emptied the pots into the midden. First, the researchers analyzed sterols and bile acids in the samples to confirm they were produced by humans. Microscopic examination of the feces revealed the eggs of whipworms ( Trichuris trichiura ) in two of the coprolites. This parasite lives in the human large intestine and can cause health problems, particularly in children. Mitchell said the team members now want to find fecal material left behind by earlier hunter-gatherers, in order to understand how the transition to farming and village life, and the resulting change in sanitary practices, may have affected human health.

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND— Science News reports that archaeologist Cynthia Larbey of the University of Cambridge and her colleagues have found evidence that modern humans roasted tubers and roots for food as early as 120,000 years ago. The starch granules found in charred plant remains that they unearthed in South Africa’s Klasies River Cave have not been linked to any known starchy plants, however. Cooked starches would have been easier to digest and would have provided a more efficient source of glucose, and thus energy, to the hunter-gatherers, Larbey explained. The roots and tubers would have been available year round, she added, and would have supplemented a diet of shellfish, fish, and game animals. Roots and tubers were cooked in the cave up until about 65,000 years ago, despite changes in tool technologies and hunting strategies. Starchy crops are thought to have been farmed in Africa beginning about 10,000 years ago. "

MARSEILLE, FRANCE—A new computer model has been used to test a variety of factors that may have influenced the extinction of the Neanderthals, according to a Live Science report. “For a long time, it was thought that Homo sapiens had simply killed the Neanderthals,” said paleoanthropologist Silvana Condemi of Aix-Marseille University. Results produced by the computer model created by Condemi and her colleagues, however, suggest that wars or epidemics brought on by contact with modern humans would have caused Neanderthals to die off more rapidly than appears to have been the case. Based on findings from the archaeological record, Neanderthals are believed to have lived alongside modern humans in Europe for some 4,000 to 10,000 years. The researchers think a slight drop in the fertility rate among young Neanderthal women, perhaps brought on by climate change and resulting food shortages, could instead be to blame. “This is a phenomenon that is limited in scope that, over time, had an impact,” Condemi said.

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL—According to a report in The Times of Israel , 400,000-year-old bits of flint once thought to have been byproducts of the toolmaking process may have instead been knapped by modern human relatives for specific purposes. The 609 flakes were found three distinct areas of central Israel’s Qesem Cave. Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to perform chemical analyses of the items and examine their edges. The researchers were able to determine that the cutting surfaces had been used to butcher animals and process tubers, hides, and bones. They also found that at least one in 10 had been refashioned. Flavia Venditti of Tel Aviv University said the study suggests the tiny tools were used in conjunction with other tools, indicating that the people who lived in the Lower Paleolithic Levant created and employed a more diversified toolkit than had been previously thought. The distribution of the tools in the cave suggests different tasks were performed in different areas, Barkai added. "

Archaeologist Iraia Arabaolaza said the camp may date to the first century A.D., and the victory of Agricola, the Roman governor of Britain, over an army of Caledonians in the Battle of Mons Graupius. It had been previously thought that the Romans only traveled a route further to the east for the invasion. This camp, Arabaolaza explained, would have been strategically located just a day’s march from other Roman camps in the region. Evenly distributed fire pits at the site are thought to have been used for baking bread. “The location of the oven was recognized by the scorching of the subsoil base, stone slabs, and burnt clay fragments, some with wood imprints and with dome molding,” Arabaolaza said. Much of the camp has been destroyed by construction and landscaping projects over the years, she added. "

LEICESTERSHIRE, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Guardian , a 2,300-year-old wooden shield was discovered in a waterlogged pit in England’s Midlands by a team of archaeologists led by Matt Beamish of the University of Leicester Archaeological Service. Beamish said it had been previously thought that shields made from tree bark, which were unknown in the Northern Hemisphere, might have been too flimsy for use in war. Tests with replica shields, however, suggest they were tough and light. The researchers recreated the shield, which measured just one-tenth of an inch thick, with green bark from alder and willow trees, and stiffened it with internal wooden laths. As the green wood dried, it tightened and became stronger and the shield rounded slightly. The ancient shield also had wooden edging around its rim, a woven boss to protect its wooden handle, and was painted and scored in a red checkerboard pattern. “This is a lost technology,” Beamish said. “It has not been seen before as far as we are aware, but presumably it is a technique that was used many ways for making bark items.” "

The analysis of mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child, suggests that the women buried next to children were not their mothers. “For now, we know that the dead buried under the same house were not related in the maternal line,” Chyleński said. The team members are still attempting to sequence nuclear genomes, which contain genetic material inherited from both parents, from the bones in order to look for other kinship relationships among the dead.

In the mid-seventeenth century, during the English Civil War, the cathedral was ransacked and the bones were taken from their wooden caskets and scattered by Parliamentarian troops. The jumbled bones were thought to belong to six Anglo-Saxon kings, an Anglo-Saxon queen, an Anglo-Norman king, an Anglo-Danish king, and two Anglo-Saxon bishops. The scientists determined, however, that the bones include the remains of at least 23 people. To date, the skeletons of 10 of the individuals have been reassembled, some of the bones have been dated, and the sex and age at death of some of the individuals have been determined. DNA testing could reveal specific family relationships among them. Isotope analysis of the bones could help the researchers ascertain where each person grew up and what he or she ate. Further research may reveal what sort of activities the people took part in, such as archery or horseback riding. In addition, damage to the bones indicates that accounts of Parliamentarian troops using the royal bones as missiles to break the cathedral’s stained glass windows may be accurate. "

Although the style of artifacts at the site suggests the people who camped there came from the east, in what is now Russia, the DNA analysis indicates the two women and one man who chewed on these pieces of bark actually came from Europe, to the south. Persson explained that DNA obtained from such gums at other sites could offer information about migration patterns, relationships, diseases, and food preferences. "

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a Science News report, Neanderthals and modern humans split from a common ancestor more than 800,000 years ago, or significantly earlier than previously thought. Paleoanthropologist Aida Gómez-Robles of University College London calculated the rate of changes in tooth shape for eight ancient hominid species, and then examined 430,000-year-old Neanderthal teeth recovered from Sima de los Huesos, a site in Spain. Based upon the steady rate of change of tooth crowns in the other hominid species, she determined that the distinctive shape of the Neanderthal teeth began forming between 800,000 and 1.2 million years ago. Analysis of Neanderthal DNA has suggested the last common ancestor of the two species lived between 550,000 and 765,000 years ago, but researchers do not agree on the speed of genetic mutations, or how consistent that change may have been over time.

The evidence suggests that some 14,000 years ago, a group of two adults, one preteen, and two children—aged six and three—entered the cave barefoot while carrying bundles of burning pine sticks to light their way. As they traveled through the cave, they crouched and crawled when the ceiling was too low to walk upright. At times, they moved in single file, with the youngest bringing up the rear. “[They] walked very close to the side wall of the cave,” Romano said, “a safer approach also used by other animals (e.g. dogs and bears) when moving in a poorly lit and unknown environment.” The group eventually reached the cave’s final room, where Roman said the children smeared clay from the cave floor on a stalagmite, at different levels according to their height.

AMHERST, MASSACHUSETTS— Live Science reports that Eric Poehler of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, independent researcher Juliana van Roggen, and Benjamin Crowther of the University of Texas at Austin suggest iron droplets, spatters, and stains found on Pompeii’s streets are evidence of ancient road repairs. Over decades, the repeated passage of carts on the city’s stone-paved streets eroded away ruts and holes that made travel difficult. The researchers said complete repaving of the streets would have been difficult and expensive, and would have blocked important routes through the city for months at a time. Molten iron, however, when poured, would have filled the holes and ruts and hardened into a smooth surface. Stone and ground-up pieces of terracotta may also have been placed in the holes. Poehler explained that the small amounts of iron that team members identified on the streets may have been spilled as slaves carried molten iron from furnaces to ruts and holes in need of repair. The researchers plan to analyze the chemical composition of the iron next, in order to determine where it was mined. "

Genetic analysis of the skeletal remains indicates that siblings had been placed together and next to a parent, he explained. “We are dealing with what you might call an extended family,” Johannsen said. “We were able to show that there are four nuclear families present and emphasized in the burial, but these individuals are also related to one another across these nuclear families—for example, being cousins.” The analysis revealed one male lineage and six female lineages among the dead, suggesting that women married into the community from neighboring groups. Johannsen thinks the people who buried the families knew them well, and may even have been the fathers of the children, since none of the fathers’ remains were detected in the grave. The men may have been away from home when the massacre occurred, he said. "

WHITEHORSE, CANADA— CBC News reports that low water levels in the Yukon River in northwest Canada have revealed a collection of historic artifacts, including nails, wooden logs and planks, and iron fixtures from sternwheel paddleboats. Yukon government archaeologist Ty Heffner said the vessels were built in warehouses and wharves stationed along the river. Some of the paddleboats burned and sank in the river as well, he explained. “Like, there’s a log cradle here, or a crib, that was used to support sternwheelers when they were hauled out of the river in the winter,” he said. All of the items are protected heritage, Heffner added. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7646-190510-south-america-climate,Neolithic,"Ancient Climate Linked to Dip in South American Population. LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a Science News report, archaeologists Philip Riris and Manuel Arroyo-Kalin of University College London examined ancient sediments and other sources of climate data, and analyzed more than 5,000 radiocarbon dates from almost 1,400 archaeological sites in South America, and determined that populations declined as rainfall patterns began to fluctuate some 8,600 years ago before stablizing some 6,000 years ago. During the 2,600-year-long unstable period, unusually wet and dry periods occurred every five years or so, rather than every 16 to 20 years, as had previously been the case. The researchers suggest the unpredictable weather may have made it difficult for hunter-gatherers to collect food, and may even have prompted them to domesticate and cultivate plants as backup food sources.

KLESSIN, GERMANY— DW.com reports that a mass grave was unearthed on private land in eastern Germany, near the Polish border, during a construction project. Werner Schulz of the Association for the Recovery of the Fallen in Eastern Europe (VBGO) said World War II–era ammunition, pieces of helmets, and insignia helped identify skeletons in the grave as the remains of 15 German soldiers and one Russian soldier. The men are thought to have been killed during heavy fighting in the winter of 1945, as the Red Army advanced through the village of Klessin toward Berlin. German soldiers eventually retreated to Klessin Castle, but the castle and village were reduced to rubble. At the time, some of the bodies of the German and Russian soldiers were buried, while others were left in trenches or ditches, or on the frozen ground. So far, volunteers working with VBGO have recovered the remains of 120 German and 100 Soviet soldiers in the region. The remains are identified from personal artifacts, when possible, and reburied in nearby war cemeteries. "

ROME, ITALY— ANSA reports that a rectangular room decorated with paintings of panthers, centaurs, and a sphinx has been discovered at the Domus Aurea, or Golden House, the emperor Nero’s 150-room palace on Rome’s Palatine Hill. Alessandro D’Alessio, an official in charge of the Domus Aurea, said conservators found the room while restoring a neighboring one. “We came across a large opening positioned in the northern corner of the covering of the room,” he said. “Lit up by the artificial light, there suddenly appeared the entire barrel vault of a completely frescoed adjacent room.” The images include the god Pan; a man with a sword, quiver, and shield fighting a panther; stylized aquatic creatures; garlands; branches with green, yellow, and red leaves; birds; flowers; fruit; and a small sphinx standing on a pedestal. The figures are shown on a white background with red and golden yellow borders. Based on the style of the paintings, scholars think the room was decorated between A.D. 65 and 68. The palace was eventually buried under the orders of Emperor Trajan, who built a bath over the palace complex in the early second century A.D. D’Alessio said the room will remain filled with earth in order to help stabilize the palace complex. "

LINCOLNSHIRE, ENGLAND— The Sleaford Standard reports that a cache of early fourth-century A.D. Roman coins was discovered in eastern England by metal detectorists Rob Jones and Craig Paul. Paul assisted archaeologists Adam Daubney of the Lincolnshire County Council and Sam Bromage of the University of Sheffield with excavation of the more than 3,000 copper-alloy coins. Daubney said the coins were found in a ceramic pot buried in the center of a large oval pit lined with quarried limestone. He thinks the cache may have been buried as a ceremonial or votive offering. Eleanor Ghey of the British Museum suggested the hoard was buried around A.D. 307, after the sudden death of Emperor Constantius. Together, Paul and the archaeologists found a second hoard of ten coins while investigating the area. "

PRITTLEWELL, ENGLAND—According to a BBC News report, the occupant of an intact burial chamber discovered in a burial mound in southeastern England in 2003 may have been an early Christian Anglo-Saxon prince. Tooth enamel fragments were the only human remains recovered from his large wood coffin, which contained gold-foil crosses that may have been placed over his eyes, and a golden belt buckle. “They would have been just on the transition between having pagan burials with all your gear but also having these crosses,” said Sophie Jackson of the Museum of London Archaeology. It had been previously thought the tomb, which measured 13 feet square and five feet deep, might have belonged to Saebert, Saxon king of Essex, but radiocarbon dating revealed it was constructed between A.D. 575 and 605, or at least 11 years before the king’s death. Researchers now think the tomb may have been built for the king’s brother, Seaxa. Among the tomb’s princely treasures were a copper-alloy hanging bowl, a lyre, fragments of a painted wood box, gold coins, the gilded silver neck of a wooden drinking vessel, glass beakers, a folding iron stool, and a sword with a pattern-welded blade and a horn handle decorated with gold wire.

The artifacts include hand axes and pebble tools made by Homo erectus , and blades made by Homo sapiens . Masojć suggested that Homo erectus migrated through the region, along the coast of the Red Sea, in addition to traveling through the Nile Valley. Some 500,000 years ago, he explained, the now desert-like region was more hospitable. Dried river beds suggest water once flowed toward the northeast and the Red Sea. "

WILTSHIRE, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that a three-foot-long core removed from a sarsen stone at Stonehenge in 1958 has been handed over to researchers at English Heritage. The core was one of three removed when archaeologists found cracks in one of the vertical stones while raising a fallen trilithon, and inserted metal rods in it to stabilize the set of two upright stones topped by a third resting horizontally across them. Robert Phillips, who worked for a diamond-cutting firm at the time, was one of the team members who reinforced the cracked sarsen stone. He kept one of the cores in a plastic tube displayed in his office in England, and then, after he retired, in his home in Florida. Phillips recently decided to return the stone core to England. David Nash of Brighton University and his colleagues have been analyzing the geochemical fingerprint of the sarsen stones at Stonehenge with a hand-held portable spectrometer, a non-destructive technique. The recently returned core comes from the interior of a sarsen stone, and so offers Nash and his team an unweathered sample. Nash said it had been previously thought that all of the sarsen stones came from nearby Marlborough Downs, but initial test results indicate it is possible they came from multiple locations. "

A parking garage on the site was demolished to make way for a new administrative center, but the building project has halted to allow for ongoing excavations. Archaeologists initially discovered a stone quay dating to the tenth century A.D. and even older wooden structures. More recent finds, however, indicate that people might have occupied the area well before the Middle Ages. Artifacts and tools related to craft production, such as wooden combs and leather shoes, could date to the seventh century.

EDGARTOWN, MASSACHUSSETS—According to a report in the Vineyard Gazette , researchers from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have recovered remnants of a World War II–era, Curtiss SB2C Helldiver-type bomber plane that crashed in the waters off Chappaquiddick Island—on the eastern end of Martha's Vineyard—in the winter of 1946. Throughout World War II, the U.S. Navy used Martha's Vineyard for training exercises and, particularly, as a testing ground for bombers, as its seashore was thought to approximate island combat zones in the the north Pacific. The discovery of the bomber follows a three-year-long effort by the Army Corps to clear some 60 acres of land on Chappaquiddick, where, estimates say, some 20,000 practice bombs were dropped between 1944 and 1947, and the danger of live ordnance remains. While the search for official records of the crash initially came up empty, the team discovered a 1946 newspaper article naming ensign Cecil M. Richards and aviation radioman second class William Robert Garrett as the Navy fliers who perished in the crash. "

VERACRUZ, MEXICO— Mexico News Daily reports that a fifteenth-century anchor has been found covered in sediment under about 40 feet of water off the coast of Veracruz by members of the Underwater Archaeology Project at the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). The anchor is thought to have come from a ship in Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés fleet. Cortés scuttled 10 of his 11 ships in 1519, in order to quash a mutiny among his crew members and force them to travel inland with him. Archaeologist Roberto Junco Sánchez and anthropologist Chris Horrell said wood on the anchor has been dated to sometime between the mid-fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, and has been identified as a type of oak that grows only in northern Spain. The team members are creating a 3-D reconstruction of the anchor, and plan to bring it to the surface and conserve it. They will continue to search the area with a magnetometer and sonar to look for the rest of the ship. "

SEVILLE, SPAIN—Carlos Odriozola of the University of Seville and his colleagues analyzed six beads recovered from prehistoric high-status graves—two found in a 5,000-year-old cave tomb known as La Molina in southern Spain, and four 4,000-year-old beads recovered from a burial in Cova del Gegant, which is located near Spain’s northeastern coast. Cosmos reports that the beads all appeared to be carved from amber, but none of them were actually made of the prized ancient tree sap. The beads from Cova del Gegant were made of pine resin layered over mollusk shell, while the beads from La Molina were made of tree resin layered over seeds. Their reddish color may have resulted from exposure to cinnabar, another prized material, Odriozola explained. He and his colleagues speculate that real amber beads may have been difficult to acquire, even for high-status individuals such as those buried in these two tombs, or these individuals may not have been as wealthy as once thought, and settled for lower cost, look-alike jewelry. A third possibility, according to the researchers, is that the fake amber beads were peddled by unscrupulous traders. Chemical analysis of other supposedly ancient amber artifacts could reveal additional counterfeits, they said. "

LEIPZIG, GERMANY— Nature News reports that a fossil discovered in 1980 in Baishiya Karst Cave, which is located on the Tibetan Plateau, has been identified as a partial Denisovan jawbone. The mandible is described as having a robust, primitive shape that shares anatomical features with Neanderthals and the Denisovan molars recovered from Russia’s Denisova Cave. Researchers were not able to recover DNA from the jawbone fossil, which is estimated to be at least 160,000 years old, but molecular anthropologist Frido Welker of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the University of Copenhagen said researchers were able to extract collagen proteins from dentine preserved in the jaw’s two very large molars. Analysis of these highly degraded proteins suggests the individual was closely related to Denisovans who lived in the Altai Mountains. And, because one of the teeth was still erupting from the jaw, scientists think the individual was an adolescent at the time of death. Some modern Tibetans carry a gene variant that allows them to live at high altitudes. Welker explained that Denisovans living on the Tibetan Plateau may have developed this adaptation and passed it on to modern humans some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago. "

Researchers led by Carla Burrell of the University of Nottingham and Silvia Gonzalez of Liverpool John Moores University analyzed proteins and genetic samples taken from the sick individuals’ bones and teeth, and determined they suffered from an unusual form of Paget’s disease. This chronic disorder occurs when new, weak bone tissue replaces old tissue, leaving it susceptible to deformities and fractures. As much as 75 percent of the bones in the skeletons of each of the individuals buried in the priory’s cemetery was affected. Some died as early as the age of 35 from the disease. People diagnosed with Paget’s disease today are typically around the age of 55 and have just one or a few affected bones. "

The fossils of elephant relatives, llama relatives, and ancient horses, as well as rocks that may have been used as tools have also been uncovered at the site. The scientists experimented with different sediments and walkers of varying sizes, and concluded the footprint could have been made by a barefoot modern human adult who weighed about 155 pounds and was walking in wet and sticky soil. Some of the dirt clung to the person’s toes at first, and then dropped into the print when the foot was lifted, they said. Radiocarbon dates for organic materials found in the same layer as the footprint suggest it was left 15,600 years ago. "

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND—A new review of 154 Neanderthal sites in central and western Europe, led by Stewart Finlayson of the University of Cambridge, has found golden eagle remains at 26 of them, according to a Science Magazine report. The researchers noted cut marks on golden eagle wing bones, which carry little meat, as well as cut marks on eagle foot bones recovered from the Neanderthal sites. The marks suggest that as early as 130,000 years ago, Neanderthals may have carefully removed feathers from the birds’ seven-foot wingspan, and separated claws and talons from eagle bodies. Modern humans are known to have made jewelry from golden eagle talons, but no such adornments have been recovered at Neanderthal sites, although the talons of a white-tailed eagle have been identified in a Neanderthal necklace. Finlayson and his team members suggest the modern humans who later migrated into the region from Africa may have emulated Neanderthals’ raptor jewelry. "

ISTANBUL, TURKEY—According to a Live Science report, researchers led by Ken Dark of the University of Reading and Jan Kostenec of the Czech National Committee of Byzantine Studies have found traces of Byzantine-era structures on the grounds of Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia, first constructed as a Christian cathedral by the emperor Justinian I in the sixth century A.D. Team members uncovered a white marble courtyard they say surrounded the original cathedral, and a library that may have held thousands of scrolls under a structure now known as the large hall. The researchers suggest they have also found the remains of the Great Baptistery, where the children of emperors were baptized. Evidence that the building’s northwest vestibule was built in the sixth century, and not during the rule of the Ottoman Empire, as had been previously believed, has also been uncovered. “The discovery of such a large ‘new’ part of Justinian’s church of Hagia Sophia is unprecedented in recent decades … and alters significantly the known plan of that world-famous building,” Dark said. In the structure’s northeast vestibule, the excavation revealed a disc-shaped piece of purple stone called porphyry embedded in the original sixth-century floor. It may mark the spot where the emperor stood for ceremonies and liturgies. “As such, it is probably the only place where it is possible to identify anywhere the precise spot on which Justinian, the most famous Byzantine emperor, stood,” Dark said."

PROSPECT BLUFF, FLORIDA—According to a Talahassee.com report, Hurricane Michael toppled some 100 large trees in Apalachicola National Forest last October and revealed traces of the “Negro Fort,” which was built by British soldiers during the War of 1812 near Fort Gadsden. The site was home to a large community of escaped slaves known as Maroons, who joined the British military in exchange for their freedom. They lived in the fort, which housed some 300 barrels of British gunpowder, on a bluff overlooking the Apalachicola River, with members of the Seminole, Creek, Miccosukee, and Choctaw tribes. Historian Dale Cox said historic records show the people who lived in the community were skilled masons, woodworkers, and farmers who grew melon and squash in fields near the fort. U.S. soldiers traveling the Apalachicola River on July 27, 1816, took one shot at the fort’s powder magazine. It exploded, killing 270 people. Many of the Maroons who survived the blast were captured and re-enslaved. U.S. Forest Service archaeologist Rhonda Kimbrough said researchers have recovered Seminole ceramics, British black glass, gun flint, and pipe fragments from the tree roots. They have also found where the fort’s field oven had been placed. "

The researchers found that the hearths did not appear to have been raked out regularly, as they would have been if they had been used frequently, and they lacked burned refuse, food residues, and bone, which are usually recovered from heavily used hearths. In fact, the analysis suggests plant life was able to grow in the burned areas and herbivores were able to graze there between fires. And charred pine cones, which do not grow locally, indicate the Neanderthals may have brought their own fuel with them when they visited. "

UNIVERSITY PARK, PENNSYLVANIA— Science News reports that evidence of human occupation of southwestern Amazonia some 10,600 years ago, or several thousand years earlier than previously thought, has been unearthed in Bolivia. Archaeologist José Capriles of Penn State University and his colleagues found burned bits of wood and clay, and the 6,250-year-old remains of hunter-gatherers buried in trash heaps made up of snail shells, fish and small animal bones, and other organic remains, at sites thought to have been regularly occupied for several months at a time. The calcium carbonate in the shells fossilized the human bones, which would have otherwise decomposed in the acidic soil, Capriles explained. He thinks the burials may have marked the claim of a group of hunter-gatherers to seasonal wetlands as the climate became drier between 8,000 and 5,500 years ago. He also noted that the people who lived in these camps may have planted sweet potatoes, cassava, peanuts, and chili peppers as they depleted local resources. "

GARDEN CITY, NEW YORK—A team of researchers at Adelphi University, led by anthropologist Anagnostis Agelarakis, examined the skeletal remains of a well-muscled man recovered from the Greek island of Thasos and attempted to determine how he died some 2,000 years ago, according to a Live Science report. Agelarakis found a nearly perfectly round hole, positioned at a 90-degree angle, in a fragment of the man’s sternum. He thought the fatal wound might have been made with a styrax, or seven-sided thrusting spear. Members of the Adelphi University art department, with the assistance of Agelarakis’ wife, anthropologist and scientific illustrator Argiro Agelarakis, created several replica weapons to attempt to recreate the hole. They soon realized that a thrown spear would not have produced a hole in a surface at a 90-degree angle, and determined the man was probably immobilized and stabbed with extreme force. Dental analysis suggests the man’s diet changed for the worse shortly before he died, Agelarakis added. The team members suggest the man may have spent time as a prisoner before being executed. "

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Independent , a genetic study of remains recovered from a Crusader-era mass burial pit in what is now Lebanon indicates that even though some of the fighters were descendants of Western Europeans and local people who lived on the eastern Mediterranean coast, the Crusaders had little overall genetic impact on the population. The burial pit, located near the ruin of a Crusader castle in Sidon, contained the burned remains at least 25 individuals. The bones bear evidence of violent injuries and have been radiocarbon dated to the Crusader period, between A.D. 1025 and 1283. A thirteenth-century Crusader coin from Italy, and five buckles with designs typical of medieval Europe, were also recovered from the pit. Of the nine individuals whose remains were analyzed, three are thought to have come from Western Europe—perhaps Spain and Sardinia. Four of the individuals were eastern Mediterranean locals, and were probably recruited to fight in the religious wars by Crusaders from Western Europe. The remaining two inviduals whose DNA was analyzed may have been the product of relationships between Crusaders and local people. Marc Haber of the Wellcome Sanger Institute said that once the fighting was over, this mixed generation joined the region’s local population, and the genetic traces of the Crusaders in the Near East eventually disappeared.

This was the site of a Roman villa whose wealthy inhabitants are known to have kept a varied menagerie. Worley said the bone, dated to the first century A.D., bears no butchery marks and appears to have been part of the earliest known rabbit in England. Further analysis suggests the rabbit was kept in confinement, she added, and may have been an exotic pet. Rabbits are native to Spain and Portugal, and it had been previously thought they were first introduced to Britain in the eleventh century by the Normans. "

Liu Suoqiang of the Guangdong Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology said the woman was deliberately put in a squatting posture. “It points to the emergence of the concepts of life and death and of primitive religious beliefs,” Liu explained. Researchers are also trying to determine whether the woman’s head was missing due to natural causes, or whether it was removed. Burials containing remains arranged in a squatting posture have been found in other prehistoric tombs in southern China and Southeast Asia, though the symbolism of the posture is unclear.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7594-190418-turkey-herding-urine,Neolithic,"Urine Salts in Soil May Mark Advent of Herding. NEW YORK, NEW YORK—According to a report in The Atlantic , Jordan Abell of Columbia University and his colleagues were able to detect a possible shift from hunting and gathering to herding at the site of Aşıklı Höyük, in Turkey’s central Anatolia region. Because the area is dry, Abell hypothesized that the sodium, nitrate, and chlorine salts contained in the urine of people and animals would not have been washed away from the soil by rain. The scientists analyzed soil samples from trash heaps, bricks, and hearths from different layers of the site, and found that between 10,000 and 9,700 years ago, the salt concentrations rose dramatically. This possible increase in urine output corresponds with archaeological evidence suggesting that the hunter-gatherers began to keep sheep and goats, but it appears that the shift toward herding may have occurred more rapidly than had been previously thought. Over a period of about 1,000 years, the researchers estimate that on average, some 1,800 people and animals lived at the settlement. That’s many more individuals than archaeologists estimate the housing for people at the site would have accommodated, suggesting that the number of goats or sheep living there had increased. The team members are now looking for a way to distinguish between human and animal urine salts as their research continues. "

She was buried in a wooden log with a bone pin, a wooden stool, and a clasp, a bead necklace, and bracelets, all made of bronze. Fragments of woolen clothing and leather were also recovered. Radiocarbon dating of the woman’s skeleton indicates she died around A.D. 30, or about 100 years earlier than had been previously thought based on the style of the grave goods. The researchers looked for evidence of the woman’s diet in the chemical make-up of her teeth, since a diet heavy in ocean fish can skew the results of radiocarbon testing. “We didn’t find any traces of Baltic fish in her diet,” said Rafał Fetner of the University of Warsaw, “but she had consumed many animal products, as evidenced by the type of proteins preserved in her teeth.” This result surprised the team members because the woman was buried near the Baltic Sea coast.

UPPSALA, SWEDEN—Paleogenomicist Federico Sánchez-Quinto of Uppsala University and his colleagues suggest European megalithic societies may have invested social power in male family lines across multiple generations, according to a Science Magazine report. The researchers investigated possible relationships among 18 men and six women buried in four megalithic tombs in Scotland, Ireland, and Sweden between 4500 and 3000 B.C. Analysis of nuclear DNA samples obtained from the remains suggests there were close kinship ties among the men buried at the Scottish site and among those buried at the Swedish site. In addition, at least six of the nine men buried in the Primrose Grange tomb, on the northwest coast of Ireland, may have descended from the same paternal line over as many as 12 generations. One of these men may also have been the father of a man whose remains were found in another megalithic tomb about a mile away. Critics of the study note the small number of individuals in the test sample, the fact that women received identical high-status burials when interred in megalithic tombs, and a separate genetic study that found a lack of close kinship ties among individuals buried at another megalithic tomb in Ireland.

EUREKA SPRINGS, ARKANSAS—The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that more than 400 glass bottles were uncovered in what may have been a root cellar located behind a building that housed the Baker Hospital and Health Resort over a period of 20 months between 1938 and 1940. The so-called hospital was owned by Norman Baker, an entrepreneur, former vaudeville performer, broadcaster, and failed politician who claimed to have found a cure for cancer. Archaeologist Mike Evans of the Arkansas Archeological Survey said printed advertisements for the hospital featured pictures of tumor specimens kept in alcohol in bottles resembling those found in the bottle dump. Some of the bottles still contain alcohol and what appears to be tissue. Evans said the samples will be analyzed by scientists at the state crime laboratory and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. The team also recovered bottles that may have held Baker’s cancer-cure elixir, which contained a mixture of brown corn silk, red clover, ground watermelon seeds, peppermint, glycerin, and carbolic acid. The hospital was closed in 1940 after Baker was convicted of mail fraud. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7588-190416-britain-early-farmers,Neolithic,"Migrant Farmers May Have Replaced Britain’s Hunter-Gatherers. LONDON, ENGLAND—According to an Associated Press report, a genetic study of human remains dating to as early as 8500 B.C. indicates that early farmers from the region around the Aegean Sea arrived in Britain some 6,000 years ago and replaced the local hunter-gather population. Previous studies have suggested these same early farmers mixed with local populations as they dispersed across continental Europe, and those who reached Britain were genetically similar to those living in Spain and Portugal. It appears, however, that the farmers did not mix with the Britons. “It is difficult to say why this is, but it may be that those last British hunter-gatherers were relatively few in number,” said Mark G. Thomas of University College London. “Even if these two populations had mixed completely, the ability of adept continental farmers and their descendants to maintain larger population sizes would produce a significant diminishing of hunter-gatherer ancestry over time.” "

EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND—According to a report in The Guardian , scientists have reconstructed the face of a dog that lived on Mainland, the largest of the Orkney Islands, some 4,500 years ago. Unearthed in 1901, its skull was one of 24 dog skulls that were deposited in a chambered cairn known as Cuween Hill some 500 years after the tomb was built. The animal, though domesticated, retained some wolf-like characteristics, and stood about as tall as a large collie. “People have speculated as to whether the fact you get so many dogs in one tomb, which is very, very unusual, suggests there was some kind of totemic thing,” said Alison Sheridan of National Museums Scotland. Similar collections of animal parts, from creatures such as sea eagles and red deer, have been discovered in other Neolithic tombs, Sheridan explained, so the people who lived near Cuween Hill may have considered themselves “the dog people.” "

The public park is also home to the Portuguese imperial family’s nineteenth-century palace, which was repurposed as the National Museum of Brazil in 1892, which suffered a devastating fire in September of 2018. Archaeologist Filipe André Coelho said the artifacts may have belonged to employees of the imperial family, or may have been given by the imperial family to the military personnel, village officials, and free and enslaved workers who are thought to have lived in the neighborhood at the time. “It worked as sort of a good neighbor policy,” Coelho suggested.

An earlier investigation at the cathedral unearthed traces of a thirteenth-century Benedictine monastery nearby, and, at first, the currrent researchers thought they might have found the monks’ cemetery. However, the oldest skeleton uncovered during the new excavation belonged to a child of about six who died about 1,000 years ago.

SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND— Live Science reports that artwork that may date to the Upper Paleolithic period has been discovered in Croatia’s Romualdova Cave by archaeologist Aitor Ruiz-Redondo of the University of Southampton and his colleagues. Some 30,000 years ago, a river flowing toward a vast plain where the Adriatic Sea now rests would have been on view from the cave’s entrance. The images were created with reddish paint applied to a layer of fossilized calcite that has crumbled away in places. Graffiti dating to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries has also damaged some of the ancient artworks. However, the researchers were able to make out the figures of a bison and ibex, which are commonly found in cave art in Western Europe. An excavation and further analysis could help confirm the art's age. “In this case, expanding the Upper Paleolithic cave art to a new area is really interesting, because it implies linking the culture of the groups that painted Romualdova with cultural features from groups well documented in Spain, France, and Italy,” Ruiz-Redondo said.

CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA—According to an NPR report, archaeologist Armand Salvadore Mijares of the University of the Philippines and an international team of researchers have unearthed bones in a cave on the island of Luzon that they say came from three individuals of a previously unidentified human species. The specimens, dated to between 50,000 and 67,000 years ago, include toe bones, finger bones, part of a thigh bone, and seven teeth. Dubbed Homo luzonensis , after the island where they were discovered, the bones combine primitive and modern traits, such as an ape-like curved toe bone that may have been used for climbing trees, and several teeth that resemble those of modern humans. Paleoanthropologist Florent Détroit of France’s National Museum of Natural History said Homo luzonensis may have descended from a population of Homo erectus that migrated out of Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago. “This is yet another piece of evidence to show that the features [of the body] definitely do not evolve at the same speed,” he said, “especially in different species in different geographical places.” Other scientists suggest Homo luzonensis and other fossil species found in Asia may have descended from other early Homo migrants out of Africa.

SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND—Ground-penetrating radar has revealed traces of a structure within the southern stone circle at Avebury, according to a Live Science report. It had been previously thought that the structure dated to the medieval period, but Josh Pollard of the University of Southampton and his colleagues say its shape matches other structures in the British Isles that are known to date to the early Neolithic period. Pottery and flint tools dating to the early Neolithic period have also been found in and around the structure. Pollard thinks the building may have been a house constructed for a high-status family sometime after 3700 B.C., and that it probably fell down before the site was enclosed with a square of stones, and eventually large rings of standing stones and earthworks. Mark Gillings of the University of Leicester said the team members plan to take the ground-penetrating radar equipment to the northernmost small stone circle at Avebury to look for traces of another Neolithic structure. “We should be able to see an echo of any house in terms of artifact densities in the surrounding soil, and if this house was also monumentalized by an enclosing square megalithic setting, we should see that too,” he said.

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND— Reuters reports that researchers led by Nick Thomson and Matthew Dorman of the Wellcome Sanger Institute have mapped the genome of a sample of cholera bacteria collected from a sick British soldier sent to Egypt to convalesce in 1916, during World War I. Cholera, which is spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the bacteria, causes severe diarrhea, and can spread rapidly in areas with poor sanitation. Dorman said, however, that the bacteria in the sample had faults that rendered it nontoxigenic, including the lack of a flagellum—the tail that allows the bacteria to swim. It is unlikely that this strain of cholera caused the widespread outbreak of cholera that occurred during World War I, Thomson explained. The scientists concluded that the British soldier probably had another infection that caused his symptoms. "

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA—According to a Science Magazine report, anthropologist Emily Hammer of the University of Pennsylvania and her colleague Jason Ur of Harvard University have created an index of several thousand high-resolution photographs taken with sophisticated cameras suspended from U-2 spy planes that flew reconnaissance missions throughout the Middle East during the 1950s and 1960s. These images, declassified in 1997, offer a more detailed look at the surface of the ground than do modern images on Google Earth. However, archaeologists have not previously used the images for research purposes because they have not been digitized, have been hard to access, and information about where the photographs were taken has remained classified. Hammer and Ur employed their knowledge of the Middle East and geographic clues in the photographs to reconstruct possible flight paths of 11 of the formerly top secret missions. The researchers also identified three known sites in the U-2 photographs: Iraqi marsh villages whose residents were displaced in the 1990s, canals at Nimrud, and prehistoric walled hunting traps known as “desert kites” in eastern Jordan.

Reassembled, the Roman emperor’s figure stands about ten feet tall and wears clothing carved with symbols representing his power and accomplishments. “On the upper part of the armor, there is the thunder of Jupiter, the celestial god of thunder,” said Celal Şimşek of Pamukkale University. Medusa, shown in the middle of Trajan's chest, represents the emperor’s frightening side, Şimşek added. Griffins, the symbol of Apollo, the god of music and poetry, indicate that the emperor also protected the fine arts. The creatures stretch their legs toward a water bowl, referring to Trajan’s gift of 30,000 denarii for travertine arches and pipes to bring water to Laodicea. The statue also depicts, in smaller scale, a figure of a kneeling enemy soldier whose hands are tied behind his back. Şimşek thinks the statue was carved in A.D. 113 by someone who had seen Trajan in person, since the face is very detailed. The statue was eventually toppled and buried by an earthquake. "

An excavation carried out by Cultural Resources Analysts found that the back of a lot owned by the Historic Salisbury Foundation was likely part of a portico to a cotton mill that served as a barracks for the prison. Timothy Roberts, who led the excavation, said a dense concentration of brick, mortar, and granite appears to indicate a corner or edge of the structure. Some of the material from the building, in particular brick, is thought to have been used in buildings that still stand nearby. The portico is known to have existed from drawings of the mill building and prison site, including those sketched by Union prisoner Robert Knox Sneden. When it was built, the prison was estimated to have a capacity of 2,500 prisoners, but by 1864 it held as many as 10,000, leading to disease, starvation, and uprisings that were put down ruthlessly. Almost all the captives were released in February 1865 as part of a prisoner exchange program, and Union forces burned the prison down in April 1865, at the end of the war. "

The evidence includes cut marks made by stone tools, gnaw marks on finger bones that may have been made by Neanderthal teeth, and the fact that the individuals were completely dismembered. The bones were found in a layer of the cave corresponding to the warmer interglacial period, between 128,000 and 114,000 years ago. Animal remains found before and after the warmer period include reindeer and woolly mammoths. The remains of large animals are missing from the layer dating to the interglacial period, however, when the landscape changed and tortoises, snakes, and rodents migrated to the area. Stress lines that typically form during periods of illness or malnutrition were also found on the Neanderthals' tooth enamel. The researchers think the individuals were consumed by other Neanderthals out of desperation. "

The large town is thought to have been a center of the Holy Moravian Empire, featuring a large church and baptistery, and inhabited by dukes, noblemen, craftsmen, tradesmen, farmers, and probably slaves. Galuška was surprised to find so many descendants still living in the area. “You have to realize East Moravia used to be a very restless area bordering Hungary,” he explained. “It was affected by a number of wars, such as the Thirty Years War, so the local inhabitants suffered a great deal and were greatly affected by all the conflicts.” "

WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA— The Virginia Gazette reports that archaeologists led by Jack Gary of Colonial Williamsburg are investigating pastureland where the eighteenth-century home of John Custis IV once stood. Enslaved Africans are also known to have lived on the property, called Custis Square, and tended its house and elaborate gardens. The foundations of the house were uncovered in the 1960s. Now Gary and his team members want to find out how the landscaping, thought to feature topiary, gravel paths, statues, and plants imported from England, was laid out. Pollen analysis could confirm what sort of plants and herbs Custis grew for the medicines he blended as an amateur physician. The researchers will also look for outbuildings where enslaved people are thought to have lived and worked. Martha Washington may have resided on the property as well, since she inherited Custis Square from her first husband, Daniel Parke Custis, who died in 1757. She went on to marry George Washington in 1759. "

OXFORD, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Guardian , a unique shipwreck has been discovered near the sunken port city of Thonis-Heracleion, which is located at the mouth of the Nile River. The vessel was constructed in a manner described by the fifth-century B.C. Greek historian Herodotus, who visited Egypt and observed the construction of an unusual trading vessel. Damian Robinson of Oxford University said the hull is the first such ship to be found. Known as a “baris,” the ship had a crescent-shaped hull made from thick planks connected with tenon-ribs fastened with pegs, rather than mortice-and-tenon joints. The archaeological evidence has helped scholars to understand the ancient text. “Herodotus describes the boats as having long internal ribs,” Robinson said. “Nobody really knew what that meant…. That structure’s never been seen archaeologically before. Then we discovered this form of construction on this particular boat and it absolutely is what Herodotus has been saying.” "

SILESIA, POLAND— Science in Poland reports that a 60,000-year-old flint workshop has been discovered on a riverbank in southern Poland. Among some 17,000 pieces of flint, thought to have been worked by Neanderthals, Andrzej Wiśniewski of the University of Wrocław and his team were able to find areas where certain kinds of tools were crafted. In fact, the researchers were able to reconstruct the waste from the production of individual tools, and determine how they had been made. Wiśniewski also said the site is the first Neanderthal flint workshop to be found in Central Europe in the open air, rather than in a cave. “It appears that in this place a community was present over a longer period, as evidenced by the large number of discovered objects,” he explained. “In addition, there are also preserved remains of mammoth, rhinoceros, and horse bones.” Microscopic traces of meat were found on a few of the tools that remained in the workshop. The others were presumably carried to other sites for use. "

Some of the graves were rectangular and oriented east-west, with the heads of the bodies at the eastern end of the graves. Other graves contained the remains of people who may have been cremated, and some of the burials may have been moved from a prior burial site and reinterred. Most of the human remains in the graves had completely decomposed, but one complete skeleton was recovered. All of the remains have been sent to laboratories for further study. "

WESTPHALIA-LIPPE, GERMANY— DW.com reports that three rural sites in central Germany where 208 Polish and Russian forced laborers were murdered and buried by Nazi troops in 1945 are under investigation. Shoes, colored buttons, pearls, a Polish language prayer book and lexicon, cutlery, and textile fragments are among the 400 artifacts recovered. Historian Marcus Weidner said many of objects came from a forest site in the Langenback Valley, where the remains of 60 women, 10 men, and a child were also unearthed. The placement of the artifacts at this site suggests the victims were told to leave their possessions at the edge of the road. Metal detectorists found bullets throughout the forest, indicating that the victims tried to escape before they were shot. Spades were also found at this site. American troops ordered the exhumation and reburial in a cemetery of the remains of 57 people killed at the second site. At the third site, a harmonica, a glasses case, a comb, a spoon, and Soviet coins were unearthed. After the 80 victims had been killed at this site, their bodies were buried in a cavity created by Nazi troops with detonated mortars. Their remains were exhumed in 1947 for reburial. To date, researchers have identified 14 of the 208 victims from the three sites. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7461-190308-paranthropus-robustus-teeth,Pre-Human,"Early Human Relative May Have Had Tooth Enamel Disorder. LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND— Science Magazine reports that paleontologists led by Ian Towle of Liverpool John Moores University suggest Paranthropus robustus , a hominin that lived in southern Africa some 1.8 million years ago, may have been susceptible to a disorder that caused golf ball–like pits on the surface of its teeth. Fossil specimens of thick P. robustus molars are often found in poor condition. The creature is thought to have lived on a diet of tropical grasses, hard seeds and nuts, and fibrous fruits, but scientists had not been able to determine whether the rough diet could have caused the pitting of tooth enamel and weakened the teeth so that they would have worn down more quickly and perhaps broken more easily. The new study compared P. robustus teeth with the teeth of other hominins and living apes, and found the pitting occurred in 47 percent of P. robustus baby teeth and 14 percent of their permanent teeth, but in only seven percent of the baby teeth of other hominins, and four percent of their adult teeth. The researchers note the similarity of the condition to a rare genetic disorder known as amelogenesis imperfecta, which can damage cells that produce enamel, but is also associated with production of thick, dense enamel. Towle and his colleagues concluded that the more frequent occurrence of pitting may have been a side effect of the evolution of teeth strong enough to cope with the tough, gritty diet consumed by P. robustus .

PETERBOROUGH, CANADA— Science News reports that human relatives living in Europe hunted small, fast-moving game some 400,000 years ago. It had been previously thought that members of the genus Homo hunted mainly large game until about 40,000 years ago. Researchers led by Eugène Morin of Trent University and Jacqueline Meier of the University of North Florida examined 21 sets of animal fossils and stone tools recovered from eight sites in southern France, ranging in age from 400,000 to 60,000 years old. They found remains of large numbers of rabbits and hares in all but one of them, and possible butchery marks were found on 17 of the sets of animal remains. Morin said colonies of rabbits were probably abundant in the Mediterranean region, and may have been easier to hunt than solitary hares. Dogs may have assisted hunters in the chase as early as 11,500 years ago, he added. "

PERTH, AUSTRALIA— Live Science reports that Alistair Paterson of the University of Western Australia and his colleagues recorded rock art made by nineteenth-century American whalers on two of the islands in northwestern Australia’s Dampier Archipelago. The carvings, which include names, dates, ships’ names, and anchor motifs, were etched on top of existing aboriginal images, which had been created over thousands of years and are found on all 42 islands in the archipelago. Whalers from America, Great Britain, France, and colonial Australia stopped at the islands—sometimes for months at a time—while hunting sperm whales and migrating humpback whales. One engraving, on Rosemary Island, was dated 1841 by a sailor on a ship named Connecticut who carved over an indigenous grid pattern on the rock. Paterson said a second indigenous grid was later inscribed over the whaler’s carving. Because some areas of the rocks were still smooth and would have served as better engraving surfaces, Paterson suggests the whalers chose the locations for their carving deliberately, although he does not know what their rationale was.

León said the objective of the project, which is sponsored by Spain’s Culture Ministry, is to help identify and protect shipwreck sites, especially those that have been lost from memory. “The most famous ships have been investigated,” he said, “but there’s a huge number about which we know absolutely nothing.” The researchers found that more than 90 percent of the ships sank in severe weather, about four percent ran onto reefs or had navigational problems; one percent were sunk during naval engagements with the British, Dutch, or United States; and less than one percent were sunk during pirate attacks. Fewer than 25 percent of these wrecks have been found to date, León added. The documents also revealed the ships headed toward the New World carried things like religious objects and stones for building churches; tons of mercury to extract gold and silver from New World ores; clothing for slaves; and weapons for putting down local rebellions.

The animals were even found in the graves of men, women, and children, she said, and were probably killed at the time of burial. A lack of cut marks on the bones suggests they were not butchered. About a quarter of the dogs in the burials were between 12 and 18 months old, perhaps because older, trained dogs were needed by the living for tasks such as hunting, transportation, protection, and herding.

OXFORD, OHIO—According to a Live Science report, classicist Steven Tuck of Miami University is investigating the lives of the survivors of the volcanic eruption that wiped out the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. He searched the region surrounding the disaster for family names distinct to the two cities in documents and inscriptions; evidence of worship of Vulcanus, the god of fire, and of Venus Pompeiana, Pompeii’s patron deity; and building construction after A.D. 79, perhaps intended to accommodate an influx of refugees. Tuck said the evidence he has found includes an inscription dedicated to a man from Pompeii who eventually died in Romania after joining the army, and the word “have,” inscribed on a family tomb in Naples. The word means “welcome” in Oscan, a dialect that was spoken in Pompeii, and was often showcased on the floor in front of houses in the city as a sort of welcome mat. Tuck also said the emperor Titus collected the money of people who had died in the eruption and did not have heirs, and sent it to cities with refugees to help build new neighborhoods, aqueducts, and public buildings for them. Tuck notes, however, that he was not able to find evidence of many of those who escaped the eruption, since foreigners, migrants, and slaves living in Pompeii and Herculaneum at the time of the disaster did not have recorded family names.

ZURICH, SWITZERLAND—According to a Cosmos report, a new evaluation of the Neanderthal remains known as La Chapelle-aux-Saint 1 suggests Neanderthals had spines resembling those of modern humans. La Chapelle-aux-Saint 1, discovered in central France in 1908, is an almost complete skeleton of an individual thought to have died some 60,000 years ago around the age of 40. He had lost many of his teeth and suffered from arthritis. Scholars originally suggested this man walked with an ape-like hunched posture and bent knees, and recent studies have suggested Neanderthals may not have had a well-developed curve in their spines. Now, Martin Häusler of the University of Zurich and his colleagues have created a virtual reconstruction from high-resolution 3-D surface scans of the specimen's vertebrae and a cast of his right hip bone, the original of which was misplaced in the 1970s. They found the angle of the pelvis and the way the vertebrae stacked produced an S-shaped spine that curved at the neck and inwards from the lower back toward the waist, much like that of modern humans. Häusler added that the wear on the hip joint was similar in both species. “We are quite confident that this is the real shape,” he said. "

HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA— CBC News reports that a room-sized underground stone vault was discovered near Province House, the home of Nova Scotia’s legislature, during construction work last summer. Archaeologist April MacIntyre said she and the members of the construction crew were surprised when they tried to break up what appeared to be bedrock. “What we discovered was an open, dry-stone-laid chamber with a semicircular, vaulted-type roof,” she explained. MacIntyre and her team investigated and measured the vault with remote cameras because it was not safe for them to enter the chamber, which is about 20 feet long by 14 feet wide, and about ten feet deep, although silt has collected on the floor. “There’s no record of anything of that nature being here on the property,” she explained. “No indications on maps or any records that we’ve been able to find.” Artifacts on the roof of the structure date to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and MacIntyre noted that the structure seems to be similar to powder magazines from the period, including one built at Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal in the late 1790s. The small hole in the structure’s roof has been covered with a cloth and the area filled with crushed stone to stabilize and mark it. "

The bones, which constitute the remains of at least 40,000 people, were exhumed in the sixteenth century from a cemetery adjacent to a twelfth-century Cistercian monastery. The cemetery had run out of burial space due to a fourteenth-century plague epidemic and religious wars of the fifteenth century. Tradition holds that the church’s original bone structures were created by one of the monastery’s monks. The church’s present bone structures were created by Czech wood-carver Frantisek Rint, who expanded on the monk’s towers in the late nineteenth century. “The bones will be cleansed of surface dirt and then soaked in lime solution,” said conservation expert Tomas Kral. “This is a natural method of preservation which was also used during the creation of these pyramids.” "

CHUKOTKA, RUSSIA— Haaretz reports that ancient obsidian tools have been found at a Mesolithic site in the Arctic Circle by a team of researchers led by Vladimir Pitulko of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Pitulko said the small settlement on what is now Zhokhov Island was inhabited by 25 to 50 people of the paleo-Arctic Sumnagin cultural complex, who hunted, fished, and lived in reindeer-skin tents. The small number of volcanic glass tools, found among some 19,000 stone tools and other objects made of antler, mammoth ivory, and bone, have been dated to between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago, when sea levels were lower and the island was still connected to mainland Siberia. Chemical analysis of the obsidian indicates it came from the Lake Krasnoye region, more than 1,000 miles away from the site. Pitulko and his colleagues suggest the obsidian could have been carried by traders traveling by dogsled, since traces of wooden sleds, and the remains of dogs who would have weighed around 55 pounds—the size of dog used to pull sleds today because they have sufficient strength but are not so large that they overheat—have also been recovered on the island.

Werra of the Polish Academy of Sciences. “It must have been similar with shiny obsidian.” During the Paleolithic period, Werra explained, obsidian was probably imported in the form of finished tools from what is now Slovakia on the Vistula River, which extends from the western Carpathian Mountains across Poland to the Baltic Sea. And, analysis of obsidian samples revealed some of them originated as far away as southeastern Turkey. Obsidian tools were used to scrape leather and wood, and for processing meat. Marks on some of the blades suggest they were attached to wooden shafts with leather strips to make spears. Werra added that few obsidian processing sites have been found in Poland, but there is some evidence that raw obsidian may have been imported during the Neolithic period and fashioned into tools locally.

At the time, an examination of the remains of one individual, who was dubbed “Ardi,” concluded that she walked with an upright gait. Among the recently discovered fossils, which are estimated to be between 4.8 and 4.3 million years old, Scott Simpson of Case Western Reserve University and his colleagues found the bones of an individual equipped with ankle bones that may have provided better support for its legs and trunk than Ardi is thought to have enjoyed. This hominin found at Gona also had a big toe that would have propelled its stride, Simpson explained. All of the A. ramidus individuals, however, are only thought to have been able to walk slowly over short distances. They also shared traits such as skeletal features that made them capable tree climbers, flat feet, and grasping, opposable toes. Simpson and his colleagues suggest the possible improvements in walking ability seen in the A. ramidus fossils could link them to the evolution of Australopithecus species, and the earliest known evidence of a human-like gait, some 4.2 million years ago.

The wood-lined tomb was discovered in the late nineteenth century at Birka, a medieval hill fort settlement, next to other graves containing weapons. The body was dressed in clothing typical of the Eurasian steppe, and was assumed to have belonged to a man because the artifacts in the tomb are usually associated with males. These include gaming pieces, the remains of a mare and a stallion, and weapons including a sheathed sword, an ax, a fighting knife, two spears, two shields, a quiver of armor-piercing arrows, and a small iron knife. The researchers reviewed the notes and diagrams made in the nineteenth century, during the original excavation, to be sure that the warrior’s carefully labeled bones had not been mixed with bones from another burial, and tested DNA from an arm bone and a tooth, concluding they were female and came from the same person. She is thought to have died between the ages of 30 and 40. "

Roberto Miccichè of the University of Palermo and his colleagues examined the bones with CT scans and created 3-D reconstructions of the skeleton. They found six cuts on the man’s sternum that were probably inflicted with a knife or dagger through his back. A twisting motion with the weapon is thought to be responsible for a piece of bone missing from the right side of the sternum. When inflicted, the cuts probably pierced the man’s lungs and heart, killing him quickly, Miccichè explained. He added that the angles of the cuts in the bone suggest the man was in a kneeling position when he was killed, and may have been bound, since the cuts were smooth and precise, suggesting he was not able to fight back. In fact, the man’s feet were so close together in the grave they may have still been bound when he was buried. "

Many of the bones came from large adult monkeys and squirrels, according to Michelle Langley of Griffith University, and pointed tools had been made from some of the animals' limb bones. In the area's rainforest environment, these animals would have been hard to find and kill, Langley said, unlike on the savannah, where large herbivores roamed in herds.

LEIPZIG, GERMANY— Cosmos Magazine reports that a new analysis of nitrogen and carbon isotopes in the amino acids found in Neanderthal collagen conducted by Klervia Jaouen of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology indicates the extinct human relatives ate a diet based on fresh meat from large mammals. The collagen samples were obtained from Neanderthal remains uncovered at Les Cottés and Grotte du Renne, which are both located in France. The individual whose remains were recovered at Les Cottés ate mostly reindeer and horses, Jaouen said, while the one found at Grotte du Renne—an infant—nursed from a meat-eating mother. It had been previously suggested that the nitrogen isotope ratios found in Neanderthal remains could indicate a diet of fish, mushrooms, putrid carrion, or fermentation arising from rotting meat. The new tests, however, point to a monotonous diet of herbivores, although Neanderthal individuals may have occasionally eaten other types of food. "

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Guardian , an excavation led by Mike Parker Pearson of University College London has investigated two Neolithic quarries in Wales at Carn Goedog, a crag where spotted dolerite rock rests in pillar-shaped slabs on the northern side of the Preseli Hills. Charcoal discovered between the slabs of rock was radiocarbon dated to the fourth millennium B.C. Wedge-shaped stone tools made of imported mudstone or sandstone had been hammered into V-shaped gaps cut into the rock between the naturally formed slabs. A platform paved with stones found at the base of the outcrop may have served as a loading dock for the pillars. It had been previously suggested that the bluestone pillars at Stonehenge were carved from rock in the southern Preseli Hills, and perhaps transported to Wiltshire by raft some 143 miles along the Severn Estuary and the River Avon to the Salisbury Plain. Team member Rob Ixer of University College London thinks it is unlikely that if the Stonehenge bluestones had been quarried at Carn Goedog, they were then dragged over the Preseli Hills in order to transport them by water. He suggests it is more likely the monoliths were transported overland from Carn Goedog to Wiltshire. In addition, Ixer said the quarries’ carbon dates are old enough to make it possible that the stones had been erected in a circle in Wales before being transported to Stonehenge. "

Curator of archaeology Kate Sumnall said the family probably shared the seat with other shopkeepers and families living in the tenement block. “This is a really rare survival,” she said. “We don’t have many of these in existence at all.” The Fleet and many other small rivers and tributaries in London were eventually routed underground as the city grew. Conservator Luisa Duarte said the low-oxygen environment produced by the muddy underground rivers has preserved a wealth of wood and leather artifacts. "

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND— Live Science reports that researchers led by Mensun Bound, director of the exploration phase of the Weddell Sea Expedition, have abandoned the search for the wreckage of Endurance , Sir Ernest Shackleton’s three-masted wooden ship equipped with a coal-fired steam engine, in Antarctica’s Weddell Sea after the loss of an autonomous underwater vehicle in inclement weather and heavy ice. Shackleton purchased Endurance , which was designed to endure icy polar conditions, and modified it for an expedition in which he planned to cross Antarctica. But Endurance became trapped in pack ice in the Weddell Sea for months and was eventually crushed, stranding the explorer and his crew of 27 on the ice as it sank in November 1915. They all survived, but the ship is believed to rest under a layer of sea ice and nearly 10,000 feet of water. Bound recalled Shackleton’s description of the area where the ship sank as “the worst portion of the worst sea in the world.” Bound's colleague, Julian Dowdeswell of the University of Cambridge, said it is unlikely that another polar research ship will attempt to resume the search for Endurance anytime soon, but he hopes this will happen eventually. “It is one of those things that stands out as an obvious challenge, and I have no doubt that that challenge will be revisited at some time in the future,” he said.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7412-190215-scotland-neolithic-halls,Neolithic,"6,000-Year-Old Longhouses Uncovered in Scotland. ANGUS, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that traces of two structures recently radiocarbon dated to 6,000 years ago have been uncovered in eastern Scotland, according to Ronan Toolis of GUARD Archaeology. The larger one, which was used for around 500 years, is thought to be the largest known Neolithic hall in Britain. Early farmers are believed to have used the buildings as living and food processing quarters, and may even have sheltered animals in them as well. The smaller of the two halls, Toolis said, was occupied for 1,000 years, and may eventually provide new insights into Scotland’s early farming communities. Smaller structures and pits in use during the same period were found around the two halls. Around 2,000 years after the smaller building went out of use, a village was built on the site. It yielded a bronze sword, a wooden sword sheath, and a bronze bangle, Toolis added. "

ROME, ITALY— ANSA reports that a well-preserved fresco depicting Narcissus gazing at his own reflection has been uncovered in a house in Pompeii. According to Greek mythology, the beautiful hunter Narcissus, son of a river god and a nymph, was punished by the goddess Nemesis for his treatment of Echo, a mountain nymph who loved him. Nemesis lured Narcissus to a pool where he fell in love with his own reflection and was unable to leave it. Alfonsina Russo, director of the archaeological site, said the room where the Narcissus fresco was discovered had a staircase leading to a floor above it, and a storeroom containing glass containers, amphoras, and a bronze funnel. Massimo Osanna, superintendent of Pompeii Archaeological Park, said other paintings in the house, found in fragments on the floor, depict maenads and satyrs, delicate floral elements, griffins, cornucopia, flying cherubs, and fighting animals. These images were damaged when the building’s ceiling collapsed under the weight of volcanic stones from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, but they will be reassembled. The excavators also uncovered a bronze bucket next to the home’s impluvium —a sunken area designed to collect rainwater from the roof. "

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON— CBS News reports that the wreckage of USS Hornet , sunk on October 26, 1942, during the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, has been found under more than 17,000 feet of water in the South Pacific Ocean. The vessel was detected near the Solomon Islands by the crew of Petrel , a research vessel established by Paul Allen, cofounder of Microsoft, who died last year. The expedition team began their search for Hornet with information from official deck logs and action reports from nine other U.S. warships that fought in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and subsequently came upon the aircraft carrier on their first search of the area with a deep-sea sonar drone. The warship’s identity was confirmed by its hull classification symbol CV-8, spotted with video footage taken by a remotely operated vehicle. Hornet played two key roles during World War II, including launching the first airborne attack on Tokyo in April 1942, and causing heavy damage to Japanese aircraft carriers and aircraft during the pivotal Battle of Midway in June of the same year.

GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN—A new statistical model developed by Bettina Schulz Paulsson of the University of Gothenburg suggests that huge stone structures were first built in what is now northwestern France some 6,800 years ago, and that megalithic construction styles spread across Europe in three waves, according to a Science News report. Paulsson processed 2,410 radiocarbon dates obtained from megalith sites and even older graves and earthen monuments to develop a timeline for when 154 different megalith sites were built. She said the model indicates the first structures, which consisted of two or more standing stones topped with a third stone or a mound of earth, spread from northwest France down the Atlantic coast and into the Mediterranean, perhaps by sailors who traveled long distances and shared their style of building with the people they met along the way. The construction of passage graves, which are now found along the coastlines of Portugal, Spain, Ireland, England, Scotland, France, and Scandinavia, are thought to have been spread by seafaring traders between 6,000 and 5,500 years ago. The final phase of the spread of megalithic structures included the construction of monuments such as Stonehenge with massive boulders some 4,400 years ago, Paulsson said. "

TAMPA, FLORIDA—According to a Live Science report, members of the RPM Nautical Foundation recently conducted an underwater survey in the Mediterranean Sea at the site of a naval battle that took place some 2,200 years ago. Historical records indicate the Roman navy destroyed much of the Carthaginian fleet, which had been carrying supplies to its armies in Sicily, on March 10, 241 B.C. The researchers recovered helmets, pottery, and six bronze rams. Research team member William Murray of the University of South Florida thinks the Carthaginians may have been fighting with Roman ships captured during a previous battle, since most of the rams recovered from the sea floor over the course of the survey project have been Roman. “You would expect that the Carthaginians, who lost the battle, would have suffered the most casualties,” he explained. The helmets may have belonged to mercenaries from Gaul and Iberia hired to man the Carthaginian fleet, he added. The team members also recovered amphoras scattered around the shipwrecks. “It’s as if they were jettisoned out into the sea, and they separated one from another and then sank to the seafloor,” Murray said. Throwing the containers overboard may have been an attempt by the Carthaginians to make the ships lighter and faster, he said. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7398-190211-scavenge-bone-marrow,Pre-Human,"Did Bone Marrow Fuel Hominin Brain Development?. NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT—According to a report in Cosmos Magazine , Jessica Thompson of Yale University and her colleagues suggest that brain growth in early hominins may have been fueled by nutrient-rich, fatty bone marrow scavenged from large-animal carcasses left behind by other predators. These early human ancestors living some four million years ago would have been able to access the marrow by smashing the bones with rocks, Thompson explains. She thinks once hominins developed a taste for marrow, they may have craved it and other fatty foods. In this scenario, the craving for more calories and fat could have driven hominins to develop tools and techniques to hunt large animals. Thompson suggests that paleoanthropologists look for evidence of bone-smashing behavior by our earliest ancestors. "

DUNEDIN, NEW ZEALAND—Katherine Hall of the University of Otago suggests that Alexander the Great may have died of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological condition, according to a Live Science report. Hundreds of years after his death, historians wrote that the king of Macedonia had died at the age of 32 in June of 323 B.C. in Babylon, after a brief illness characterized by fever and paralysis. Many believed he had been poisoned. The historic record also suggests that Alexander's body did not decay for seven days after he was declared dead. Hall suggests these symptoms could be explained by Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes gradual paralysis and could have put Alexander into a deep coma resembling death. In addition, while the syndrome is generally extremely rare, it occurs more often in the region where Alexander died, particularly in the spring and summer. "

The painted hand images, which are in poor condition, are thought to be more than 20,000 years old. They were found during work to document Paleolithic paintings in the cave, including six other hand prints. In all, eight of the painted hands, which range in color from dark violet to red, are located on the ceiling of the Polychrome Room, where images of horses, steppe bison, a doe, and what may be a wild boar were also painted. The ninth hand painting is in the room farthest from the cave’s mouth, and is thought to be the impression of a child’s hand that was covered with black pigment.

Located in Russia’s Altai Mountains, Denisova Cave boasts high ceilings and three chambers overlooking the Anui River, which made it a desirable place for hominins to live. The studies used multiple methods, including optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating, to date the cave’s sediments, tools, and fossils. The new chronology suggests the Denisovans arrived in the cave more than 100,000 years earlier than previously thought, or about 287,000 years ago, and left about 55,000 years ago. Tools from the earliest layers look different from Neanderthal tools recovered from other caves in Siberia, and may have been crafted by Denisovans. Neanderthal remains in the cave were dated to between 193,000 and 97,000 years ago, and the remains of a child whose mother was a Neanderthal and father was a Denisovan were dated to between 118,100 and 79,100 years ago. Scientists still want to know who created the 43,000- to 49,000-year-old ornaments made of bone, teeth, ivory, and ostrich eggshell found in the cave. They resemble ornaments made by modern humans living in Eurasia, but no modern human remains have been found in Denisova Cave.

The pages are thought to have been part of a text known as the Vulgate Cycle, or Lancelot Grail Cycle, which Sir Thomas Malory used as a source for Le Morte D’Arthur . Leah Tether of the University of Bristol said the books were printed in Strasbourg between 1494 and 1502, and are thought to have been bound in England in the early sixteenth century. The older Arthurian parchment fragments were probably in the binder’s workshop, and were likely reused in the process of attaching the pages of the newer book to its covering. At a later date, when the books were rebound, the pasted Arthurian sheets were probably reused as flyleaves. A study of the books with infrared technology could reveal more information about them. "

ROME, ITALY— Live Science reports that bioarchaeologist Claudio Cavazzuti of the Museo delle Civiltà and his colleagues suggest it may be possible to determine the sex of an individual from burned bone fragments, based on a study of 124 burials and their grave goods held in the museum’s collections. The samples date to between the twelfth and sixth centuries B.C., a time when bodies in Europe were almost exclusively cremated, Cavazzuti said. The scientists measured various bone fragments in the burials, such as the width of the kneecap, the diameter of the head of the radius in the forearm, and the length of a tiny hand bone called the lunate. They then compared these measurements to artifacts in each burial thought to hint at the sex of the dead, such as weapons for men and weaving tools for women. Cavazzuti said the size of the bones in 21 of the 24 measurements taken predicted a sex for the individual that matched the gender suggested by the grave goods. The researchers plan to test their method on other sets of human remains. “It’s very important to reconstruct the ritual customs, but also the demographic structure of these societies,” Cavazzuti explained.

LONDON, ENGLAND—Neanderthals may have been capable of hunting animals from a distance, based upon a new study of the Schöningen spears conducted by a team of researchers led by Annemieke Milks of University College London. Science Magazine reports that previous experiments involving Neanderthal hunting technologies have often relied on first-time spear throwers, and so it had been thought that the weight of the six-foot-long, 300,000-year-old wooden weapons discovered in a coal mine in northwestern Germany would have limited Neanderthals to stabbing prey at close range. Milks, however, asked skilled javelin throwers to attempt to hit a target with replicas of the two-pound Paleolithic weapons, and found they were able to throw them more than 60 feet with enough force to kill prey. Accuracy was more difficult for the athletes to achieve: They hit the target about 17 percent of the time at a distance of 65 feet, and about 25 percent of the time at distances of 33 feet and 50 feet. Milks and her team conclude that Neanderthals, like modern humans, could have employed a variety of hunting strategies."

LONDON, ENGLAND—The Folkton Drums, a set of 4,000-year-old decorated chalk cylinders discovered more than 100 years ago in a child’s grave in northern England, and a similar carved chalk cylinder recovered more recently near England’s southern coast, may have been replicas of wooden measuring devices employed by Neolithic monument builders, according to a Live Science report. Anne Teather and Andrew Chamberlain of the University of Manchester and Mike Parker Pearson of University College London determined that the circumferences of the objects were based on the “long foot,” or about 12.7 inches—a standard length found in the concentric circles of standing stones and timber posts in Neolithic monuments. Winding a string around each of the different-sized drums various numbers of times, the researchers were able to produce measurements of exactly ten long feet. The various sizes of the drums may have come into play when fractions of the measure were needed, Teather suggested. “Another explanation is that the drums were instructional teaching aids that would have been used to demonstrate some of the principles of mathematics and geometry,” she said.

His coffin was labeled with an engraved lead plate, which allowed archaeologists to make the identification. Grandfather of noted Egyptologist William Matthew Flinders Petrie, Flinders is remembered as the first explorer to circumnavigate Australia. His ship, HMS Investigator , carried a crew of artists and researchers, including a botanist, a gardener, a geologist, and an astronomer. In 1803, while returning to England, Flinders stopped French-held Mauritius for repairs to Investigator , and was arrested and held for more than six years because England and France were at war. Flinders used the time to work on a manuscript describing his voyages that was published the day before his death in 1814.

Older artifacts found in the building, including an enameled bronze reliquary casket made in Western Europe, are thought to have been placed in the church when it was consecrated. “The number and type [of the religious artifacts] speaks of the important role this parish church played in the life of the residents of the southern quarters of Trapesitsa,” Rabovyanov said.

HAIFA, ISRAEL— The Times of Israel reports that two figurines depicting horse heads uncovered by recent heavy rains have been discovered at separate locations in northern Israel. One of the figurines is thought to be about 2,800 years old, and the other around 2,200 years old, based on their styles. The older figurine, which dates to the Israelite period, was found in the Beth Shean Valley. Its bridle and reins, and the left hand of a rider were marked with red coloring that is still visible. The younger figurine, recovered at Tel Akko, dates to the Hellenistic era. Red pigment was also used to depict reins and a harness on it. Adi Erlich of the University of Haifa said horses in the Levant during these periods would have been associated with strength and military might, and would have been used for travel rather than farming. Statues of horses were thus likely to have been created to honor the rider, she explained. "

NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK—According to a CNN report, a new study of two million-year-old fossils suggests that two hominin specimens unearthed in South Africa’s “Cradle of Humankind” in 2008 by Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand are the remains of a juvenile male and adult female of the species Australopithecus sediba . It had been previously thought the two individuals may have been members of different species because of differences in their lumbar vertebrae. Anthropologist Scott Williams of New York University and his colleagues examined the collection of 135 fossils, including vertebrae, ribs, and sternums, and concluded that the differences in the vertebrae could be attributed to developmental age differences. The skeletal study also suggests A. sediba was able to walk on the ground and climb trees. "

Built in the late 1960s, the buildings were concealed from view, not recorded on maps, and described in Soviet documents as communication centers. Kiarszys’ research, however, suggests the buildings housed military personnel and nuclear warheads. “The power of warheads varied from about 0.5 to 500 kilotons,” he said. “Those warheads were to be used in the so-called Northern Front, for invasion of the northern part of western Germany and Denmark.” Each of the sites consisted of three zones, including a restricted area where warheads were likely kept, a garage area, and housing for Russian troops. Nuclear physicists did not detect any lingering radiation at the sites. "

The walls were in fact about three feet below the tessellated floors. Crummy said the original fortress and barracks were built by the men of the Twentieth Legion. “In A.D. 43, the emperor traveled to Britain to lead [the] army into Camulodunum where he took the submission of a number of British kings,” he explained. The structures will likely be damaged by pilings for a new building, and so were carefully recorded. The rest of the site was covered with a thick layer of sand. "

The information included in the table helped Eric Scerri of the University of California, Los Angeles, to date the document to between 1879 and 1886. Scerri explained that the elements gallium, discovered in 1875, and scandium, discovered in 1879, are included on the classroom table, but the element germanium, discovered in 1886, is not.

While excavating a year-round settlement site known as Shubayqa, a team of researchers led by zooarchaeologist Lisa Yeomans of the University of Copenhagen noticed a dramatic increase in the number of bones of small animals such as hares. The condition of many of the bones indicates they were digested by a carnivore, but they were too large to have been swallowed by humans. The researchers suggest the bones are more likely to have been digested by dogs, who may have helped the human residents of Shubayqa increase the number of small, fast animals they caught by chasing the prey into traps or enclosures.

Researcher Joanna Hambly of the Scottish Coastal Archaeology and the Problem of Erosion Trust said researchers had recovered a quern stone, used for grinding food, in addition to a wall and what may have been parts of circular stone structures. A piece of a quartz flake was even found in the bone it had been used to butcher. “To find the remains of a butchery site is incredibly rare,” Hambly said, “the survival of a single action in prehistory preserved in intertidal peats.” Between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, she added, the forest consisted of birch, hazel, willow, aspen, rowan, oak, Scots pine, alder, ash, and elm trees. All of the trees were gone by about 2,500 years ago, due to human activity and rising sea levels. Radiocarbon dating will help date the artifacts. "

PLOVDIV, BULGARIA— Archaeology in Bulgaria reports that luxurious residential and public buildings dating to the Roman era have been discovered on the southern slope of three hills in the heart of the ancient city of Philipopolis, which was also known as Trimontium. The six structures include a temple dedicated to multiple deities, an inn with a tavern, residential buildings, and a brothel, according to Zheni Tankova of the Plovdiv Museum of Archaeology. The temple is noted for its marble, clay, and terracotta figurines of deities worshipped by the Thracians, Romans, Greeks, Phrygians, and Persians. “In addition to the over 600 terracotta fragments, we’ve found some 300 clay lamps,” Tankova said. “It was odd that they had barely been in use but all of them had had their handles broken off.” Big ceramic storage vessels known as pithoi and vessels for cooking, eating, and storing olive oil and wine were recovered from the inn, which had been outfitted with hearths. One of the inn's rooms may have been reserved for use by women, since bone hair needles and a bronze female bust were found there. A structure near the inn resembles a brothel unearthed in Pompeii, although the one found in Pompeii is about 200 years older. "

The queen and bishop were found in a beam over the barn’s main entrance and are believed to have served as protective amulets, placed there to help keep the occupants and their livestock safe, according to archaeologist Adam Daubney of the Lincolnshire County Council. “We know that in the 1800s, people used to place artifacts at boundaries and thresholds of properties to help ward off evil spirits,” he said. “These tended to be things like shoes, miniature bibles, or mummified cats. We haven’t seen chess pieces before.” He adds that the pieces, which were made from plaster of Paris or crushed stone and then probably dipped in resin, were specifically chosen for their symbolic value. “It seems likely that the praying Bishop and Queen—the latter which might have served the role of Mary—were carefully selected from the chess set as pieces that might have particular spiritual power to ward off evil,” said Daubney.

The researchers found very little evidence of inflammation or infection in the bones, or signs of diseases brought on by malnutrition, such as rickets or scurvy. Injuries commonly inflicted through fights or falls from horseback, such as broken noses, ribs, and legs, were detected in the bones, however. Wear and tear associated with horseback riding was also seen in the people’s spines. Karstens and her colleagues concluded that Bronze-Age Mongolians probably lived in small nomadic groups that enjoyed plenty of exercise and avoided living near accumulations of their own waste. "

The researchers scanned the interior of Little Foot's fossil skull and constructed a virtual 3-D model of the tiny structures in its inner ear. They then compared Little Foot’s anatomy to the inner ears of 17 early hominin species, 10 modern humans, and 10 chimpanzees. The study concluded that Little Foot’s ear canals are ape-like, and most closely resemble those of chimpanzees. Since the structures of the inner ear are linked to balance, Australopithecus may have moved in a way similar to chimpanzees as well. "

The woman was between the ages of 45 and 60 when she died, and her skeleton showed no signs of prolonged physical labor. Ultramarine, a rare and expensive pigment made from lapis lazuli mined in Afghanistan, was only used to color the finest illuminated manuscripts during the medieval period, explained historian Alison Beach of Ohio State University. In addition, Monica Tromp of the Max Planck Institute for Science of Human History said the presence of the pigment on the woman’s remains could indicate that she worked as a scribe. Perhaps she licked her brush to draw it into a point, or maybe she prepared the pigment for a scribe or artist, and inhaled the blue dust while grinding lapis lazuli into powder. "

MADRID, SPAIN—According to an El País report, researchers at Spain’s National Archaeology Museum have analyzed the results of computed tomography scans conducted on three Egyptian mummies several years ago, and determined that one of the mummies belonged to Nespamedu, a high-ranking priest who lived between 300 and 200 B.C. The nearly 3,000 images of Nespamedu’s mummy revealed a range of charms and plaques tucked in its wrappings. The iconography of these items suggests he worked as an eye doctor in a chapel in Saqqara, and was Ptolemy II’s personal eye physician, which may have required him to travel to Alexandria. This conclusion is based on the presence of two plaques that feature the god Thoth and the Eye of Horus. Thoth was known in Egyptian mythology for replacing Horus’ eye after it was lost in a battle with Set, the god of chaos. For this reason, Thoth is seen as the god of ophthalmologists. On his head, Nespamedu wore a headband adorned with a winged scarab charm with a solar disc that featured an image of the god Khepri, who was linked to resurrection and rebirth. Nespamedu also wore a Usekh collar, an item reserved for the Egyptian elite. "

OSLO, NORWAY—DNA analysis of horse teeth recovered from Viking graves at 17 sites in Iceland suggests nearly all of the horses were male, according to a Live Science report. “Since horses are so hard to sex morphologically unless fairly well-preserved, whole skeletons are found, we know very little about the varying roles of male and female horses in the past,” said Albína Hulda Pálsdóttir of the University of Oslo. She noted that these horses were well cared for in life and may have been chosen for burial because of their symbolic virility and aggression as stallions. Meanwhile, female horses whose remains were found outside of noblemen’s graves are likely to have been eaten, Pálsdóttir said. Further research will compare the test results for the Icelandic horses with Viking-Age horses who lived in other Northern European countries between the late ninth and early eleventh centuries. "

The remains of at least 110 mammoths, mixed with hundreds of fragments of flint blades for processing meat and hides, have been recovered from the site. “We finally have a ‘smoking gun,’ the first direct evidence of how these animals were hunted,” said Piotr Wojtal of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The piece of flint measures about three tenths of an inch long, and is thought to have been the tip of a spear that was driven into the animal’s body. Wojtal said the spear was probably thrown from a distance with great force, since it would have had to pierce the mammoth’s thick skin and layer of fat in order to reach the bone. The wound would not have been fatal, however, he explained, but was likely to have been part of a coordinated attack by several hunters. "

Xipe Totec, god of fertility and regeneration, is usually depicted wearing sandals, a loincloth, and the skin of a sacrificed human. The site is thought to have been constructed by the Popolocas between A.D. 1000 and 1260, before they were conquered by the Aztecs. Worship of Xipe Totec later spread throughout Mesoamerica. Accounts of rituals dedicated to the god suggest people were sacrificed through combat or shot with arrows on one platform, and then skinned on another platform, which conforms to the layout of the newly discovered temple. Priests are then said to have worn the skins in rituals. Sculptures found in the temple include two large skull-like figures carved from imported volcanic stone, and a torso measuring about 31 inches long. A right hand is shown hanging from the figure’s left arm, perhaps representing the skin of a sacrificed person. The written sources also say a green stone would have been placed in a hole in the statue’s belly during ceremonies. "

WASHINGTON, D.C.—The levels of nitrogen-15 in Neanderthal bones are so high that they suggest the early human relatives ate more meat than do carnivores such as hyenas. According to a Science News report, paleobiologist Kimberly Foecke of George Washington University thinks those high levels of nitrogen-15 might be due to the condition of the meat that Neanderthals consumed. To check the levels of nitrogen in rotting meat, Foecke left steaks cut from animals that had been raised without hormones or antibiotics outside in a box covered with mesh, and sampled them daily for 16 days. Preliminary results suggest that the levels of nitrogen-15 fluctuated as the meat rotted, and increased during the first week, while the meat was still moist. Foecke says that could account for the high levels of nitrogen-15 found in Neanderthal remains, since the carcass of a large animal might have fed a Neanderthal group for several days. She will next test what happens to the levels of nitrogen-15 in cooked and smoked meats over time. "

Most ice wells in the city were much smaller than this one, according to David Sorapure of the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA). “What this one does and why it is significant is it bridges the gap between [the time when] ice was only for the very wealthy, to a kind of mass availability of ice,” he explained. By the early nineteenth century, the ice house was filled with ice imported from Norway by an entrepreneur, who had it transported to the site on the newly constructed Regent’s canal.

The horse, one of two, or perhaps three, found thus far in the villa’s stables, still wears a military-style harness. The team has also unearthed bronze elements of what they believe to be a type of saddle with four horns and a wooden substructure that provided stability for the rider at a time before the adoption of stirrups. This saddle design is known to have been for military use. According to Massimo Osanna, the director general of the Pompeii Archaeological Park, the horses were thoroughbreds and belonged to the wealthy villa’s owner, who may have been a general in the Roman army.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7263-181221-little-foot-brain,Pre-Human,"Ape-Like and Human-Like Features Found in Hominin Brain. JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA— Live Science reports that paleontologist Amélie Beaudet of the University of the Witwatersrand and her colleagues used micro-computed tomography to make an endocast of the interior of the skull of “Little Foot,” a 3.67-million-year-old Australopithecus individual discovered in South Africa’s Sterkfontein Caves. “I was expecting something quite similar to the other endocasts we knew from Australopithecus , but Little Foot turned out to be a bit different, in accordance with its great age,” Beaudet said. Little Foot’s brain was asymmetrical, suggesting that the two sides of the brain performed different functions, just as the brains of modern humans and apes do. Little Foot’s visual cortex, however, takes up a greater portion of the brain than it does in later Australopithecus specimens. Beaudet thinks Little Foot’s ape-like brain could resemble that of a common ancestor to chimpanzees and humans. The differences its brain and later Australopithecus brains may also show that brain evolution occurred in fits and starts, she said. "

NATHAN, AUSTRALIA—A new study suggests that ancient human bones from Australia held in museum collections around the world could be linked to living descendants through DNA analysis, according to a Science Magazine report. Geneticists Joanne Wright and David Lambert of Griffith University, at the request of Tapij Wales, an Australian traditional owner, analyzed samples of DNA obtained from 27 aboriginal Australian ancestors whose remains were up to 1,540 years old and had been either repatriated or excavated from indigenous lands. They were able to sequence mitochondrial genomes for all 27 individuals, and nuclear genomes for 10 of them. This information was then compared to DNA derived from saliva samples donated by 100 living aboriginal Australians. Wright and Lambert found that all 10 of the nuclear genomes showed close genetic relationships with the communities now living on the lands where the remains were found. Mitochondrial DNA, however, was less reliable as a way to identify a living community’s ancestors, Lambert added. "

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS—According to a Live Science report, a 2,800-year-old stone cosmetic container inscribed with an incantation written in Aramaic has been discovered in a small building at the site of Zincirli, which is located in southern Turkey. Madadh Richey and Dennis Pardee of the University of Chicago said the inscription, written by “Rahim son of Shadadan,” describes the capture of a creature called the “devourer,” who is said to be able to produce “fire.” The inscription also states that blood of the “devourer” can be used to treat someone suffering from that “fire.” Illustrations of a centipede, a scorpion, and a fish accompany the text, so the “fire” could refer to an insect’s sting. Richey added that the inscription is thought to be a century older than the building where it was found, suggesting it was preserved for its significance after the death of its original owner, according to the director of the excavation, Virginia Herrmann of the University of Tübingen.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7257-181219-san-diego-mine,Modern,"World War I Shipwreck Site Investigated. WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to an Associated Press report, after a review of historic records and a remote underwater inspection of the wreckage of USS San Diego , a team of scientists, archaeologists, and historians have concluded that the warship, which sank on July 19, 1918, struck an underwater mine planted off the coast of Long Island by a German submarine. Their analysis suggests the explosion did not occur inside the vessel, and the hole in the hull did not appear to have been caused by a torpedo strike. In addition, German records revealed that a submarine called U-156 was in the area at the time, planting explosives. The 500-foot-long San Diego was carrying nearly 3,000 tons of coal for a trip across the Atlantic Ocean when the explosion, which the commander described as feeling like a “dull heavy thud,” broke through an area of the hull that was only a half-inch thick. San Diego fired between 30 and 40 rounds in case a submarine was nearby, but it sank less than 30 minutes after it was struck. Most of the 1,100 sailors on board escaped to safety on life rafts and dinghies. "

CAMBRIDGESHIRE, ENGLAND—According to a Royston Crow report, an excavation on the grounds of the Wimpole Estate, located in the East of England, has uncovered a settlement dating to between 100 B.C. and 150 A.D. Coins, cosmetic implements, horse harness fittings, brooches, a ring, imported pottery and glass, military uniform fittings, a spearhead, and an ax head were recovered from the site, which was situated near Ermine Street, a Roman road that linked London to Lincoln and York. Archaeologist Shannon Hogan of the National Trust said the team also found a small figurine made from copper alloy of a person holding a torc. The figurine is thought to represent the fertility god Cernunnos. “The artifact is Roman in origin, but symbolizes a Celtic deity and therefore exemplifies the continuation of indigenous religious and cultural symbolism in Romanized societies,” she explained.

The street is thought to have been built in the third century A.D. of syenite, a coarse-grained local stone similar to granite. Archaeologist Maya Martinova said the roadway led to the ancient agora—a square line with shops on three sides. Traces of a sewerage system and a pipeline made of pottery were also uncovered. "

BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA—According to a Gizmodo report, archaeologist Alexei Vranich of the University of California, Berkeley, employed historical data, 3-D printed pieces, and architectural software to create a virtual reconstruction of Pumapunku, a ruined 1,500-year-old temple in western Bolivia. Built by the Tiwanaku culture between A.D. 500 and 1000, the temple was restored and reused by the Inca between A.D. 1300 and 1570, and described by Spanish conquistadors as a “wondrous” structure with “gateways and windows carved from single blocks.” Vranich and his team manipulated architectural fragments of the structure, re-created with a 3-D printer at four percent of their actual size, to build a hypothetical model, and then fed that information into architectural software. “What we found out is that it appears they were making prototypes for each type of stone type, and then would have copied one after the other,” he said. “It’s almost like it was a pre-Columbian version of Ikea.” Vranich’s reconstruction also suggests the temple’s gateways were built in graduated sizes to produce a mirror effect. “It would create an effect as if you were looking into infinity in the confines of a single room,” he said.

WARSAW, POLAND— Science in Poland reports that researchers led by Jacek Tomczyk of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University have reexamined 8,000-year-old bones that were unearthed in the 1950s near the Narew River with electron microscopy and computed tomography. The bones are believed to be the remains of a male hunter. It had been previously thought that the man’s damaged skull showed signs of cannibalism, but the new study suggests he actually lived for seven or eight days after being struck on the front of the head with a sharp tool. “It turns out that the damaged skull shows traces of healing that cannot be seen with the naked eye,” Tomczyk said. The partial burning of the bones may have been part of a Mesolithic burial practice. "

CUSCO, PERU—According to a report in The Peruvian Times , an earthquake estimated to have occurred around A.D. 1450 left lasting signs of damage on Machu Picchu’s Temple of the Sun and other buildings under construction during the reign of the Ninth Inca Pachacutec. “We see openings between rocks and stones, which is not typical of the Incas because they employed an impeccable, perfect construction,” said Carlos Benavente of the Cusco-Pata Research Project. “Some edges of the rocks are broken, which means that in the undulation of the earth, they hit each other, which caused the breaks.” Benavente then said that the architects changed tactics after the earthquake, and began building in trapezoidal shapes with giant stone blocks at the base of walls that narrowed at the top. He thinks the Incas stayed in the earthquake zone despite the dangers because the fissures in the earth also carried water. “They preferred to improve the structural conditions of their homes rather than move away from the water resource,” he explained.

The intact tomb measures 33 feet long and about 10 feet wide. The well-preserved decorations depict the owner of the tomb, a royal purification priest named Wahtye, in scenes with his mother, wife, and other relatives making pottery and wine, and practicing religious observances. They are also represented by large, colorful statues placed in niches. Other scenes on the walls show musical performances, boats, the manufacture of the tomb’s funerary furniture, and hunting.

AUKLAND, NEW ZEALAND— The New Zealand Herald reports that The Daring , a two-masted schooner that wrecked on the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand in 1865, has been lifted out of the sands intact. Members of the Classic Yacht Charitable Trust raised money to recover the vessel, which was just two years old when it was blown ashore by a storm. Security was in place around the clock to protect the site from scavengers. Once the sand was removed from the ship’s interior, the team recovered several nineteenth-century artifacts, including a leather shoe, coins, a cup, clay pipes, and wine bottle caps. The Daring was eventually loaded onto a truck, and hosed down by the Muriwai Volunteer Fire Brigade. Plans for the conservation of the ship are being finalized. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7247-181214-maize-domestication-process,Pre-Columbian,"Corn Domestication May Have Taken Thousands of Years. WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to a Science News report, the domestication of the corn plant began in southern Mexico some 9,000 years ago, and continued in Mexico and the southwestern Amazon for several thousand years. It had been previously thought that corn domestication was accomplished in southern Mexico relatively quickly. Logan Kistler of the Smithsonian Institution and his colleagues reconstructed the genetic history of the maize plant by analyzing and comparing the genomes of 108 varieties of modern maize, 11 samples taken from ancient maize remains, and one sample obtained from ancient teosinte, the wild ancestor of the modern maize plant. The study suggests that when the ancestor of modern maize was carried to South America from Mexico more than 6,500 years ago, it still carried many teosinte genes. Kistler suspects farmers in southwestern Amazonia continued the process of domestication by planting the partly domesticated maize with rice and cassava in soil that had been enriched with charcoal, compost, and other ingredients.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7246-181214-neanderthal-skull-shape,Pre-Human,"Neanderthal DNA May Affect Skull Shape of Modern Humans. LEIPZIG, GERMANY—According to a Live Science report, paleoanthropologist Philipp Gunz of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology suggests that modern humans who inherited certain fragments of Neanderthal DNA may have more oblong brains and skulls than other modern humans. Gunz and his colleagues took computed tomography scans of seven Neanderthal skulls and 19 modern human skulls, then constructed imprints of the skulls’ braincases. They compared the shapes of these braincases with MRI scans of some 4,500 people whose genetic data was also known. The data indicates Neanderthal DNA fragments in modern human chromosomes 1 and 18, which are linked to brain development, may produce less round heads. However, as neurogeneticist Simon Fisher of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics clarified, “The effects of the Neanderthal gene variants are small, you would not be able to see them in a person’s head shape when you meet them.” "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7245-181214-norway-late-neolithic,Neolithic,"Study Tracks Population Changes in Late Neolithic Norway. OSLO, NORWAY— Science Nordic reports that researchers led by Svein Vatsvåg Nielsen of the University of Oslo’s Museum of Cultural History analyzed hundreds of radiocarbon-dated artifacts from archaeological sites across Norway in order to track changes in the country’s Late Neolithic population. Nielsen said the study identified an increase in human activity in eastern Norway some 6,000 years ago, which could signal the arrival of early farmers from the east. DNA analysis of human remains could reveal whether migrant farmers replaced the hunter-gatherers who lived there, he explained. Archaeologists usually track the spread of farming in the area with a certain type of stone ax, he added, because the preservation of artifacts in the region’s acidic soil is poor and it has been heavily plowed for centuries. The new study also supports the idea that Norway’s Late Neolithic farmers reverted to hunting, gathering, and fishing. Farming was eventually reintroduced during the Bronze Age. “The settlement pattern changes very clearly when we approach 5,300 years ago,” Nielsen said. “Coastal sites fall out of use, and long houses and grains begin to show up.” "

KIEV, UKRAINE—Nadiia Kotova of the Institute of Archaeology at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and her team unearthed two carved rocks resembling snake heads at Kamyana Mohyla I, an archaeological site near the Sea of Azov in southern Ukraine, according to a Live Science report. Both of the carvings date to the Mesolithic period, although one is older than the other. Carved sometime between 8300 and 7500 B.C. from yellow sandstone, the first of the two snake heads weighs almost three pounds, and is triangular in shape with a flat bottom. Two eyes were carved on the stone’s upper surface near two knobs, and a long line for a mouth was carved near the flat edge. It was found near a fireplace, along with shells and flint tools. The smaller stone snake head, also found near a fireplace, weighs about one pound and was dated to around 7400 B.C. Kotova said this carving features a flattened, round shape and has a neck, eyes, and nose. “They were probably used during ceremonies,” Kotova explained. "

Mikhail Shunkov of the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, in the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said the “pencil” may have been used by either the Denisovans or Neanderthals who inhabited the cave. “We cannot say how exactly it was used, but we believe it was for some artistic purpose,” Shunkov said. Similar implements have been unearthed at another Paleolithic site in the Altai Mountains, he added. Beads made of ivory and soapstone were also recovered at the site, along with a marble pebble bearing traces of ocher. "

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Telegraph , Neolithic cattle bones unearthed at 11 archaeological sites in the Balkans show wear and tear consistent with pulling heavy loads. The study, led by Jane Gaastra of University College London, suggests cattle were put to work as early as 6000 B.C., about 2,000 years earlier than previously thought and before the introduction of the plow and the wheel. Researchers think that, in the Balkans, cattle would have helped early farmers clear forests and build settlements. Gaastra says cattle in Britain may even have even helped build Stonehenge some 5,000 years ago, by dragging bluestones around 160 miles from Wales to Wiltshire. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7237-181211-peru-alpaca-domestication,Pre-Columbian,"Soil Cores Searched for Evidence of Alpaca Domestication. PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA—According to a Live Science report, organic geochemist Thomas Elliott Arnold of the University of Pittsburgh and his colleagues analyzed sediment cores from lakes in southeastern Peru for changes in the ratios of signature chemicals found in human and ruminant feces, in order to estimate when domestication of alpacas might have taken place. In the samples from Lake Arapa and Lake Orurillo, the researchers determined the portion of ruminant poop increased after about A.D. 600, at the beginning of the Wari Empire, through around A.D. 1400, the time of the Inca Empire. Arnold thinks it is unlikely that an uptick in the number of wild deer accounted for the dramatic increase in ruminant feces. “You’d have to assume a bunch of deer suddenly went on a mating frenzy and congregated in and around the Orurillo region,” he said, adding that alpaca domestication is a more likely cause.

Plowing and forest planting some 50 years ago damaged much of the cemetery, resulting in a large number of iron and bronze artifacts scattered over the area. But the team members did find three intact graves. One held burned human remains in a ceramic urn. Cremains had been poured directly into pits in the ground in the other two graves. “While the first complete graves probably belonged to warriors—because we discovered weapons in the graves, including a ritually bent metal sword—we are also finding buckles and other decorations in the area,” Socha said. “This shows that the cemetery belonged to the entire community—probably women, men, and children.” "

UPPSALA, SWEDEN— Science Magazine reports that human genetic material has been recovered from 8,000-year-old pieces of birch bark pitch that were unearthed in western Sweden in the 1980s. Birch bark pitch, derived from resin, was heated and chewed to make it pliable, and used as a fastener by hunter-gatherer toolmakers. It also may have just been chewed, like gum. A team led by Natalija Kashuba, who was then a student at the University of Oslo, ground samples from three wads of the hardened resin into powder. They then detected human DNA in all three samples, from three different individuals—two female and one male. Based on the size of the tooth marks and signs of tooth wear evident in the resin, the chewers are all thought to have been between five and 18 years old. The DNA analysis also suggests the chewers were from a group known as Scandinavian hunter-gatherers, who lived in Sweden and Norway. "

DALBEATTIE, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that the 1950s excavation of the Mote of Urr, a motte-and-bailey castle in Scotland’s Southern Uplands, has been published by a team of researchers from Guard Archaeology. The structure was first built in the late twelfth century and is thought to have been destroyed by fire. When it was rebuilt, a large, central stone-lined pit was dug for use as an oven, furnace, or kiln, and the hill, or motte, on which the structure stood was made taller and a double palisade was built to enclose its summit. The excavation team, led by artist and archaeologist Brian Hope-Taylor, also found traces of a trench and a timber bridge across the moat that surrounded the motte. In all, the castle was occupied for more than 200 years. “Urr was probably partly destroyed during the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century,” said Richard Oram of Stirling University, who researched the history of the site. “There is a large gap in the documentary record for the latter part of the fourteenth and first half of the fifteenth centuries, by which time the estate was being rented out to tenant farmers,” he said.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/7188-181206-sweden-neolithic-plague,Neolithic,"New Strain of Plague Found in Neolithic Remains in Sweden. MARSEILLE, FRANCE— Live Science reports that a new strain of Yersinia pestis , the bacteria that causes plague, has been identified in human remains from a Neolithic tomb in Sweden by a team of researchers led by biologist Nicolás Rascovan of Aix-Marseille University. The bacterial DNA came from the dental pulp of a 20-year-old woman who is thought to have died about 4,900 years ago from the deadly pneumonic form of the disease. Based upon comparisons with other strains of Yersinia pestis , Rascovan and his colleagues suggest this one diverged about 5,700 years ago, making it the oldest known strain of plague. It had been previously thought that plague first traveled to Europe from the Eurasian steppe as people migrated west and replaced European farmers, but the age of the plague strain found in Sweden suggests that European farmers may have already suffered from the infection and been in decline when the Eurasians arrived. Karl-Göran Sjögren of the University of Gothenburg said the presence of the plague in Sweden could reflect the growth of bigger settlements and poor sanitary conditions, use of wheeled transport, and increased contact among groups of people through trading networks in the Neolithic world, all of which may have helped spread the pathogens. The scientists have not yet found direct evidence of plague in any of these large Neolithic settlements, however. "

NOVOSIBIRSK, RUSSIA—According to a report in The Siberian Times , archaeologists have found a 50,000-year-old piece of worked woolly mammoth tusk in the southern gallery of Denisova Cave. Alexander Fedorchenko of the Novosibirsk Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography suggests the curved ivory object is a fragment of an ornament whose large size indicates it was worn by a Denisovan man. A cord would have been threaded through holes in either end of the piece and then tied around the wearer's head in order to keep his hair out of his eyes. There is evident wear and tear on the artifact, which was eventually discarded. Such ivory “tiaras,” as they are called, have been found in other parts of Siberia, but those decorated items were created between 20,000 and 28,000 years ago by modern humans. The Densiovan tiara suggests the tradition could be older than previously thought. "

Scholars knew of the village from historic sources, but its exact location had been lost. Test excavations in the settlement revealed a high number of horse remains. Some of the horse bones were smaller and lighter than the others, and may represent animals that had been bred for use in war by light cavalry called hobelars. Their agile mounts, bred in Ireland and exported to England and Scotland, came to be known as hobby horses. The breed is now extinct.

LONDON, ENGLAND—Excavation of an early nineteenth-century cemetery in southwest London has revealed evidence that the population endured disease, deformities, malnutrition, violence, dangerous working conditions, and pollution, according to a report in The Guardian . Osteoarchaeologist Kirsten Egging Dinwiddy of Wessex Archaeology said the people who were buried in the cemetery at the church of St. George the Martyr led “a life of drudgery and just-about surviving.” The bones of one of the women, she explained, showed that she suffered from congenital syphilis. Her shoulders and upper arms showed signs of strenuous work, her nose was broken, and a wound in her skull made with a thin blade is thought to have been fatal. A flattened nose, a depression in his left brow, and battered knuckles suggest that one man, who also suffered from syphilis, had “several violent altercations,” Dinwiddy said. Many of the graves in the cemetery contained the remains of children under the age of 12, she added. "

CAITHNESS, SCOTLAND— BBC News reports that analysis of DNA obtained from the bones of a woman who died in what is now Scotland more than 4,250 years ago offers a new interpretation of her possible appearance and ancestry. The remains of the woman, now known as Ava, were discovered in a rock-cut tomb during road construction in 1987. An earlier reconstruction suggested she had red hair and blue eyes, but the latest analysis of her genome indicates she actually had brown eyes and black hair. The data also suggests she was lactose intolerant, and was descended from northern European migrants to Britain. “The revelation that her ancestors were recent northern European migrants is exciting, especially as we know that she has no, or very few, genetic connections with the local Neolithic population who resided in Caithness before her,” said archaeologist Maya Hoole of Historic Environment Scotland.

WARSAW, POLAND—According to a Science in Poland report, researchers led by Małgorzata Kot of the University of Warsaw's Institute of Archaeology are investigating the burial of a child whose remains were discovered 50 years ago in a shallow grave in a cave in south-central Poland’s Sąspowska Valley. Some of the child’s bones were found in university storage boxes, but the location of the skull, which was sent out for study shortly after the original excavation, is currently unknown. Radiocarbon dating of the bones revealed the child, who died at about the age of ten, lived in the second half of the eighteenth century or the turn of the nineteenth century, at a time when most people were buried in cemeteries, making the cave burial unusual. A photograph of the excavation, published in the 1980s, shows that the child was buried with the skull of one chaffinch in his or her mouth, and another near his or her cheek. The birds’ skulls were recently reexamined, but no clues to their significance in the grave were detected. “We only know that these were the remains of adult birds,” Kot said. "

JENA, GERMANY— Live Science reports that stone hand axes similar to those made by human ancestors some 1.5 million years ago in Africa have been recovered in Saudi Arabia and dated to as recently as 190,000 years ago. It is unclear who made the tools at the site, which is known as Saffaqah. “However, hominins that have been found with Acheulean tools include Homo erectus , who was probably a direct ancestor of humans,” explained Eleanor Scerri of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. The study suggests the hominins who crafted the tools, and traveled throughout the region on its waterways, may have encountered modern humans, who are thought to have entered the Arabian Peninsula at about that time. “Although the site of Saffaqah was not a desert when these Acheulean hominins were there, it was probably still quite an arid environment,” Scerri added.

DRESDEN, GERMANY—According to a report in Cosmos , a team of scientists led by Anna Shevchenko of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Cell Biology has analyzed food residues in pots unearthed at the Mesolithic site of Friesack 4, which is located in northeastern Germany. Shevchenko and her team explained that protein analysis allows scientists to distinguish between ancient substances and recent contaminants, and may even identify ingredients from specific animals and plants. Changes in the properties of the proteins can also point to cooking methods, they said. In one of the 6,000-year-old pots, they found traces of poached freshwater carp eggs. A crust on the rim of the pot, spotted with electron microscopy, suggests it was probably covered with a cap of leaves. The scientists were not able to determine the species of the leaves, and they are not sure whether they were used to flavor the roe as it cooked, or just keep the heat of the fire in the pot. Analysis of another dish from the site detected a meal made of pork cooked with bones, sinews, or skin. "

Evidence from the site, known as Nwya Devu, suggests humans were able to survive at the area's extremely high altitude at least 15,000 years earlier than previously thought. The researchers suspect the toolmakers were hunters who followed herds of gazelles, horses, yaks, and maybe even woolly rhinoceroses to the Tibetan Plateau, and speculate that Denisovan genetic material may have contributed to their ability to adapt to the harsh environment. The types of tool technologies at the site also point to interactions between early Tibetans and people living in Siberia and Mongolia. "

Mohamed Sahnouni of Spain’s National Research Center for Human Evolution and his colleagues say meat-chopping tools found in North Africa were made about 2.4 million years ago, or about 200,000 years more recently than the oldest known tools in East Africa. The scientists think the tools could have been crafted by descendants of East African toolmakers who migrated into North Africa, or they may have been created independently. The animal bones came from savanna-dwellers such as elephants, horses, rhinoceroses, antelopes, and crocodiles that may have been hunted or scavenged from carnovores’ fresh kill sites, Sahnouni said. No hominin remains were found with the tools, so the researchers are not sure who made them. "

LINCOLNSHIRE, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Guardian , an Anglo-Saxon cemetery dating from the late fifth to mid-sixth centuries A.D. and containing at least 20 graves has been discovered in England’s East Midlands. The men in the cemetery were buried with shields and spears, as would be expected. The women, however, were interred with elaborate brooches to fasten their clothing and necklaces made of amber, glass, and rock crystal beads. The only remains of children recovered during the excavation were of a baby cradled in a woman’s left arm. Hugh Willmott of the University of Sheffield said the skeletons and artifacts in the cemetery hint at the movement of goods and people during the Anglo-Saxon period. Some of the women carried fabric bags held open with rings made of elephant ivory from sub-Saharan Africa. Silver buckles and rings recovered from the graves, he added, resembled those associated with other Germanic communities to the south, and isotopic analysis of the bones of one of the women suggests she grew up in the chalk hills along England’s southeastern coast.

SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH—According to a Cosmos Magazine report, environmental changes are more likely to have wiped out Africa’s megafauna than is hunting by Homo erectus, which emerged some 1.9 million years ago and has previously been blamed for causing the extinctions. Paleoecologist Tyler Faith of the University of Utah and his colleagues examined more than 100 fossil assemblages spanning the past seven million years found in Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia. The researchers found that African megafauna species of elephants, hippos, rhinoceroses, giraffes, and camels began to decline some 4.6 million years ago, or about 2.5 million years before the arrival of H. erectus. Faith adds that the rate of extinction did not accelerate when H. erectus finally emerged. Analysis of climate data, changes in soil chemistry, and trace elements in animal teeth suggests that a global drop in levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide led to expansion of grasslands and loss of forests and woody vegetation that the large-bodied mammals relied upon for food. “It’s really a long-term ecological process that’s really difficult to pin on increased carnivory by the tool-using, meat-eating hominids,” Faith said."

ATLANTA, GEORGIA— Live Science reports that people may have adapted to living in the cold temperatures, low oxygen levels, and intense ultraviolet radiation of the Andes Mountains within a few thousand years of migrating to South America. An international team of researchers collected DNA samples from the remains of people who lived in the highlands around Lake Titicaca, including hunter-gatherers who lived between 8,000 and 6,500 years ago at the site of Soro Mik’aya Patjxa, the 3,800-year-old remains of early farmers, and 1,800-year-old remains found in the Rio Uncallane, a series of cave-crevice tombs. They then compared these people's DNA with DNA samples from other ancient peoples and present-day populations in the coastal lowlands and the highlands. The study suggests people living in the highlands developed adaptations to life at higher altitudes such as bigger hearts and slightly higher blood pressure, splitting from lower-altitude populations about 8,750 years ago, or at about the same time permanent settlements appeared in the Andes. Highlanders also appear to have adapted to digesting potato starch while they transitioned from hunting and gathering to domesticating wild tubers. "

One of the two sites, a ceremonial complex last excavated in 2015, flourished between 1200 and 500 B.C., and features massive stone monuments, infant burials, mortars for preparing food and pigments, and artifacts made of gold and materials imported from the Amazon and Pacific regions. The older of the two sites, constructed some 5,000 years ago, was originally thought to have been a settlement when it was excavated in 1985. But Perlès and Nuñez say its structures, with vertical stones and capping slabs, are similar to those at the nearby ceremonial complex and probably served a similar purpose. Many of its mortars and grinding stones were also marked with red pigment, they add. The researchers suggest the sites were built by small groups of people who found enough water and food to survive in the desert, and came together to build the sites, perhaps for religious purposes.

When the bowl cracked, it was repaired with a staple and strips of bronze that serve as wood rivets. Martin Carruthers of the University of Highlands and Islands said wooden bowls and other wooden objects may have been more common in Iron Age Orkney than previously thought, since the islands are mostly free of trees. The repair, however, suggests the wooden bowl was a valued object. "

CAIRO, EGYPT—According to an Associated Press report, Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of several inscribed fragments of stone in the Matariya neighborhood of Cairo, which was once part of the ancient city of Heliopolis. Most of the ancient structures in Heliopolis were dismantled and reused to build the city of Cairo during the medieval period. Egyptologist Dietrich Raue of the University of Lepipzig said one of the inscriptions dating to the Later Period, between 664 and 332 B.C., mentions that the deity Atum was responsible for the flooding of the Nile River. The oldest of the inscriptions dates back some 4,000 years. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/7129-181107-france-embalmed-heads,Iron Age,"Possibly Embalmed Heads Unearthed in France. MONTPELLIER, FRANCE— Live Science reports that scientists led by archaeologist Réjane Roure of Paul Valéry University examined thousands of Iron Age skull fragments recovered from the fortified Celtic site of Le Cailar, which is located on a lagoon of the Rhône River. The researchers estimate the fragments, which date to the third century B.C., represented about 50 broken-up skulls. Weapons were found alongside the bones. Chemical analysis of 11 of the skulls detected conifer resin in six of them, suggesting the heads had been embalmed. Roure and his team think the weapons and embalmed heads may have been put on display in a large, open space near the settlement gate, where they would have been seen by visiting Mediterranean traders. Ancient Greek and Roman sources claimed that Celts living in Gaul decapitated their enemies after battle and hung the heads around their horses’ necks as trophies. Iron Age sculptures depicting the practice have been found in southern France. Roure said sources also indicate the Celts displayed the heads in front of their homes “to increase their status and power, and to frighten their enemies.” "

The dates suggest the images are some 4,500 years older than cave art depicting animals found on the nearby island of Sulawesi. The three animals, drawn with reddish-orange ochre, are thought to be Bornean banteng, a type of wild cattle that still lives on the island.

ST LOUIS, MISSOURI—Paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus of Washington University in St. Louis has examined data on the skeletal deformations of 66 individuals who lived within the last 200,000 years in the Middle East and Eurasia, according to a report in Science Magazine , and found that about two-thirds of their abnormalities occur in less than one percent of modern humans. Trinkaus suggests that early humans may have suffered a higher frequency of birth defects, since it would be extremely unlikely that such rare conditions would not only be preserved, but then discovered by archaeologists in the numbers that they have been. Perhaps, he noted, as other researchers have suggested, people born with abnormalities were seen as shamans and given careful burials that made their bodies more likely to be preserved. A lack of nutrients during pregnancy and early childhood could also have left marks on skeletons. But Trinkaus says some of the disorders affected only one side of the body, and many were found in burials that did not receive special treatment. Most early humans are believed to have have lived in small, isolated populations, he said, which could have led to inbreeding and harmful mutations. He also points out many of these conditions would have been debilitating, requiring care and social support in order for the individuals to have survived for as long as they did. "

Andreas Hennius of Uppsala University says that pits uncovered during a road construction project and dated to between A.D. 680 and 900 were not used for making charcoal, as had been previously thought, but instead for tar manufacture. The pits, discovered near pine forests, were filled with pine wood, covered with turf, and set on fire. Each production cycle could have resulted in about 80 gallons of tar, Hennius said. Smaller tar kilns dating to between A.D. 100 and 400 have also been found. "

Archaeologist Shaun Sullivan said the Lucayans may have carried sandy clay from a nearby estuary to create smooth living surfaces. Remains of shellfish, turtles, and possibly iguanas and hutia, a rodent-like creature, were also recovered. “At other Lucayan sites in these islands there was a far greater variety of shell but this one seems to be focused on conch, maybe due to the concentration of conch in the area and the ease with which they could obtain them,” Sullivan explained. Analysis of minerals in the pottery from the site could help the researchers determine whether the Lucayans traded with peoples living on the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba. "

LINCOLN, NEBRASKA—Figurative mosaics dating to the second century A.D. have been uncovered in a public toilet at the site of Antiochia ad Cragum, according to a report in Live Science . Located on Turkey's southern coast, Antiochia ad Cragum was an important Roman commercial center. Birol Can of Uşak University in Turkey said the public toilet was next to the city’s council house, and probably accommodated large crowds of men. The two images in the latrine’s flooring riff on well-known myths, explained Michael Hoff of the University of Nebraska. In one image, Narcissus is shown staring at his own phallus, rather than at the usual reflection of his face. The other image features Ganymede, who, according to tradition, was kidnapped by Zeus, who had taken the form of an eagle, and made to serve as a cupbearer to the gods. Ganymede is usually depicted in Roman art as a youth holding a stick and rolling a hoop as a toy. In the picture in the latrine, however, he is shown holding a sponge with tongs, perhaps for wiping down the facility. And Zeus, in the form of a heron, is shown sponging Ganymede. “You have to understand the myths to make it really come alive, but bathroom humor is kind of universal as it turns out,” Hoff concluded.

ŻELECHÓW, POLAND— Science in Poland reports that researchers have investigated the site of a late medieval castle in eastern Poland using lidar and other non-invasive scanning methods. “We knew that the castle existed, although information about its location, size, and construction was not preserved anywhere,” said Wojciech Bis of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Most of the written sources concerning the castle, which belonged to the noble Ciołek family, were destroyed during World War II, he explained. The researchers had expected to find traces of a massive stone structure, so they were surprised when testing revealed an oak and earth rampart reinforced with stone and surrounded by a moat. High groundwater levels preserved much of the wood, dated to about 1466, including door seats, beams from the external walls, and boards from the internal walls. A massive stone foundation at the site may have supported a brick mansion for the Clołek family to live in, Bis added. And, decorative stone tiles from several furnaces have been uncovered in the living quarters. Traces of fires and a cannonball dating to around the time the site was abandoned in the early sixteenth century have also been found. "

BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA— Science Magazine reports that Tanya Smith of Griffith University used teeth to investigate the effects of climate and environment on the growth of two Neanderthal children who lived in southeastern France's Rhone Valley some 250,000 years ago. Smith and her colleagues examined thin sections of the Neanderthals’ tooth enamel with a polarized light microscope, and compared them to samples obtained from the teeth of a modern human child who lived at the same site in the Rhone Valley about 5,400 years ago. Markers for stress in the daily growth lines of the enamel indicate that both Neanderthal children experienced frequent illnesses while toddlers. Chemical analysis of the amount of barium in their teeth suggests Neanderthal mothers weaned them at the age of two-and-a-half, which is about the same age to which modern human hunter-gatherers are known to nurse their children. Oxygen isotope analysis appears to show that the Neanderthal children experienced cooler winters and greater climate variation than the modern human child did, even though they lived in the same area. Finally, both Neanderthal children were exposed to lead at least twice, perhaps from food or smoky fires contaminated by two nearby lead mines. "

Patrick Roberts of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and his colleagues analyzed carbon and oxygen isotopes in the animals’ teeth, and found evidence that the environment was similar to a savanna, since the animals likely ate grasses and drank water from sources fed by rainfall. And, possible butchery marks have been found on two of the animal fossils. The researchers therefore suggest early humans would not have had to adapt to harsh conditions in order to cross the Arabian Peninsula after leaving Africa. "

PENSACOLA, FLORIDA— The Pensacola News Journal reports that conservation of a Spanish breastplate that dates back at least 450 years has revealed decorative details on its surface. Recovered from the site of the Emanuel Point I shipwreck in 1996, the armor is thought to have been worn by a conquistador in Tristan de Luna’s army in 1559. At the time, the armor was probably about one-tenth to one-quarter of an inch thick. Now, after years underwater, the iron has been converted into iron sulfide measuring only about one-fiftieth of an inch thick. Concretions on its surface, however, measuring up to three inches thick preserved its shape. John Bratten of the University of West Florida said he poured epoxy into the back of the armor and left it to harden for several years to make a cast. Student James Gazaway has continued to clean and conserve the breastplate over the past year. “Right around the neckline there’s four parallel rows of lines about one millimeter apart,” he said. “Very precise, definitely inscribed, and part of the original decoration work on the piece.” "

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON—A new study of Neanderthal anatomy suggests the extinct human relatives had greater lung capacity and straighter spines than modern humans, according to a report in New Scientist . An international team of researchers created 3-D scans of the remains of Kebara 2, a 60,000-year-old male Neanderthal skeleton discovered in Israel in 1983, and compared them with scans of living modern human men. Asier Gómez-Olivencia of the University of the Basque Country in Spain said the shape of the Neanderthal rib cage could have accommodated a larger diaphragm, making it possible for the individual to take in a large amount of air without expanding his ribs. Neanderthals probably required more air than modern humans to power their greater muscle mass, he explained. The large thorax may have also helped Neanderthals to conserve heat in cold regions as well. "

CAIRO, EGYPT—According to a Live Science report, researchers from the French Institute for Oriental Archaeology and Liverpool University have discovered a possible system for moving stone blocks out of an alabaster quarry at the site of Hatnub in Egypt’s Eastern Desert. Tool marks and the presence of two inscriptions related to Pharaoh Khufu suggest the system dates to the Fourth Dynasty, some 4,500 years ago, when the Great Pyramid was constructed in Giza. “This system is composed of a central ramp flanked by two staircases with numerous postholes,” said Yannis Gourdon, codirector of the joint mission. He suggests the stone blocks would have been placed on a sled and attached to the wooden posts with ropes. The ropes would have acted as a “force multiplier,” making it easier to pull the sled up the ramp, even on steep slopes. "

SURREY, ENGLAND— The Guardian reports that a red silk velvet bag that may have once held the severed head of Sir Walter Raleigh after he was executed for treason has been discovered in the attic of West Horsley Place. This was once the home of Carew Raleigh, Sir Walter's son. After Raleigh was beheaded in 1618 at Whitechapel, London, his body is said to have been removed from the execution site and buried in St. Margaret’s Church in Westminster. Less clear is what happened to his head. According to some accounts, it was turned over to Raleigh's widow, Elizabeth Throckmorton, who stored it in a red bag until her death. Historical records also indicate the head was eventually buried in 1660 with the remains of Carew Raleigh’s three children, who died in an epidemic. Peter Pearce, director of the Mary Roxburghe Trust, which manages West Horsley Place, said the red velvet bag will be analyzed for possible connections to Raleigh. However, it had been presumed that Raleigh’s head was buried along with its bag in 1660. Historian Anna Beer also has doubts, noting that a range of myths have attached themselves to the dashing explorer, soldier, and courtier since his death. "

Tushingham said she had suspected the tests would reveal traces of bearberry in the pipes, which were recovered from three Nez Perce archaeological sites along the Snake River and are now held in museum collections, since it had been previously thought that tobacco was introduced to the region by European explorers. Tushingham suggests that Nicotiana quadrivalvus , also known as Indian tobacco, may have been cultivated by the Nez Perce, since it does not grow naturally so far north. The researchers explained that the locally produced tobacco was less potent than the dried tobacco later carried to the region by European explorers, and was therefore quickly replaced. "

Cartilaginous river lampreys are jawless parasites that latch onto host fish with circular rows of keratin teeth. Their lack of bone means evidence of lampreys rarely survives in the archaeological record.

Gordon Noble of the University of Aberdeen and scientists with the Northern Picts Project excavated sites where Pictish carvings had been discovered in the past. These including Dunnicaer, a coastal fort found to have been in use between the second and fourth centuries A.D., and a wooden enclosure known as Rhynie, found to have been in use between the fourth and sixth centuries A.D. The researchers suggest the new dates for these sites push back the Picts’ use of symbols, which may have been inspired by contact with the Romans and their writing system. Noble said it is unlikely scholars will crack the Pictish code, however, unless a text written in both Pictish symbols and a known language can be found. "

TORONTO, CANADA—Justin Jennings of the Royal Ontario Museum and his colleagues are mapping transport routes and circular geoglyphs in southern Peru’s Sihuas Valley with information collected on the ground and from satellite and drone imagery, according to a Live Science report. They think the geoglyphs, most of which are believed to date to between A.D. 1000 and 1450, were made by people who were taking breaks while traveling on foot. Measurements of the distances of the geoglyphs from the paths indicate the circles were more likely to be created close to a path than far away from one. The study also suggests the circles are found more frequently where the path or the view changed, such as after a steep climb to a flat “pampa” landscape. “It’s a moment of change, a moment of rest,” Jennings explained. The circles were made by exposing lighter sediment under rocks and dirt on the surface of the reddish-tan ground. Broken pottery and caches of painted stones, perhaps left behind as offerings, have also been found in the circles. "

Friedkin archaeological site in central Texas, underneath a stratigraphic layer containing Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Long thought to have been made by the first people to have arrived in the Americas, Clovis tools, marked by their long, triangular shape, date to around 13,000 years ago. Michael Waters of Texas A&M University said the 12 spear points, found among 100,000 stone artifacts at the Friedkin site, span a 2,000-year period and suggest a progression from stemmed points, to short, triangular-shaped points, to the Clovis style. Eleven of the weapons were chipped into leaf shapes with slightly narrower stems. Points similar to these have been unearthed in other areas of the western United States and dated to the pre-Clovis period, but archaeologists had not been able to show a progression from the earlier, leaf-shaped points to Clovis-style points before now. However, the twelfth point from the Friedkin site, which dates to between 14,000 and 13,500 years ago, is short and triangular with a flat base. Waters believes that this blade could have been developed by the descendants of the earlier weapons makers, or it may have been introduced by migrants who moved inland from the Pacific coast, or through an ice-free corridor. "

Researchers led by Mate Ilkic of the University of Zadar are also investigating archaeological sites on the Isle of Ricul to see if they can be linked to Bronze Age settlements that are now under water. So far, they have also recovered cherry pits, stone tools, ceramics, a rectangular piece of stone that may have been part of a fence, and part of a thick wall that may have been built as a defense. “They did not lack meat, as indicated by the discovery of many bones of various domestic animals, cattle, goats, and sheep and, judging by the millstones for grinding grains, they also had bread,” Ilkic said. The seaside dwellers probably ate fish, too, he added. "

SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND—According to a BBC News report, a shipwreck radiocarbon dated to 400 B.C. has been found at a depth of more than one mile in the Black Sea by a team of English and Bulgarian researchers, who say the vessel resembles one depicted on a Greek vase dated to 480 B.C. The team members created a 3-D map of the ship, which measures about 75 feet long, with remotely operated vehicles. Its rudder, rowing benches, and the contents of its hold remain intact, they found, due to the cold, oxygen-free waters of the Black Sea. The great depth of the wreck site is also thought to have contributed to the vessel’s remarkable condition. “It’s preserved, it’s safe,” said Helen Farr, a member of the University of Southampton’s Black Sea Maritime Archaeological Project. “It’s not deteriorating and it’s unlikely to attract hunters.” Farr added that the researchers do not yet know what is in the ship’s cargo hold. “As archaeologists we’re interested in what it can tell us about technology, trade, and movements in the area,” she said.

The study links the beginning of a trend toward “intense aridification” some 575,000 years ago, as reflected in the sediment cores, with the development of more sophisticated and wide-ranging stone tool technologies sometime between 500,000 and 320,000 years ago. Owen explained that as the climate varied, the region’s mammal fauna changed, and the toolkits found in the area’s archaeological record also evolved.

The remains were recovered from boathouses near the Herculaneum waterfront, where the people are thought to have died in a pyroclastic surge measuring between 400 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit and moving at a speed of nearly 180 miles per hour. Spectroscopic analysis of red and black residues on the victims’ bones revealed high concentrations of iron, suggesting their blood had boiled. The resulting steam could have produced enough pressure to burst their skulls, the scientists said, as can be seen in the skeletal remains. However, critics point out that this process could have occurred after death. In the city of Pompeii, which is located farther away from the volcano, victims may have been killed by heat shock, but the temperatures are not thought to have been hot enough to vaporize their flesh and blood.

STANFORD, CALIFORNIA—According to a report in The Atlantic , research conducted by evolutionary biologists Dmitri Petrov of Stanford University, David Enard of the University of Arizona, and their colleagues suggests an influx of Neanderthal genes may have boosted the immunity of modern human populations who moved into Europe from Africa tens of thousands of years ago. Genes can offer protection from disease by altering the way human proteins interact with viruses. Scientists think both groups of early humans would have been vulnerable to unfamiliar viruses when they first came in contact with each other, but interbreeding could have exchanged genes that offered some resistance to infections. “We call it the poison-antidote model,” Enard said. So Enard and his team compared genes in segments of modern human DNA known to have been inherited from Neanderthals with a list of more than 4,500 human proteins known to interact with viruses. They found that genes inherited from Neanderthals by modern Europeans react with RNA viruses such as HIV, influenza A, and hepatitis C, which indicates the genes may have helped modern human ancestors combat ancient RNA viruses. Enard also examined the sequenced genome of a Neanderthal man who lived in Siberia some 50,000 years ago, and found that he carried stretches of modern human DNA that also corresponded with human-virus-interacting proteins. These genes may have offered him some protection from viruses introduced by modern humans. "

ATHENS, GREECE— Tornos News reports that a team of researchers led by Bonna Wescoat of Emory University conducted excavations in the western section of the Sanctuary of Great Gods on the Greek island of Samothrace, which is located in the northern Aegean Sea. The area under investigation included a theater, a 340-foot-long roofed colonnade or stoa, and the perivolos, or court surrounded by a low wall, where the statue known as the Nike of Samothrace once stood. The excavation uncovered some architectural features of the theater first revealed during excavations in 1923, pieces of statue bases made of red rhyolite and white limestone, and fragments of a ceramic pipe that ran under the theater. The researchers also noted that the stoa had been built of limestone from the quarry of Akrotiri. "

CAIRO, EGYPT— Egypt Today reports that work to reduce the level of groundwater at the Kom Ombo Temple in Aswan revealed two inscribed pieces of sandstone. Mostafa Waziri, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the first piece of sandstone dates to the 19th Dynasty (1295-1186 B.C.), and depicts King Seti I standing in front of the god Horus and the goddess Sobek. The images are topped with a winged sun, which is a symbol of protection. There are 26 lines of hieroglyphic text below the images. The stone has been broken in two, but its inscriptions are in good condition, Waziri added. The second stone shows King Ptolemy IV, who ruled from 222 to 205 B.C., standing with his wife, Arsinoe III, the god Horus, a winged sun, and 28 lines of text. Waziri said this stone was found broken into several pieces. The discovery of a sandstone sphinx sculpture at the site was announced earlier this month. "

OTTAWA, CANADA—HMS Erebus and its sister ship, HMS Terror , were abandoned in 1848 in the Canadian Arctic during Sir John Franklin’s ill-fated search for the Northwest Passage. Live Science reports that recent investigation of the wreckage of HMS Erebus by Parks Canada archaeologists yielded nine artifacts, including metal parts of rigging instruments, a piece of tarred felt, a ceramic pitcher, and an artificial horizon—a tool used in navigation with a sextant to determine latitude when the horizon is obscured. The pitcher and artificial horizon were found in an officer’s cabin on the lower deck of Erebus . Bad weather prevented divers from entering Sir John Franklin’s cabin, however, where they hoped to discover the ship’s logs and other documents that could provide information about what happened to the ship. “This proved to be the worst ice conditions we’ve ever seen,” said underwater archaeologist Ryan Harris. “We were only able to cover a day and a half of scientific diving on the site.” "

Science Nordic reports that Svein Harald Gullbekk of the University of Oslo and his team looked for patterns in the medieval artifacts, which he thinks were dropped from people’s pockets during services in Sweden’s Bunge Church. “When we investigated where hairpins, pearls, and other objects associated with women were found in Bunge Church in Gotland, we found that more than 95 percent of them were on the north side of the nave,” he said. This corresponds with the historic practice of segregating men and women within the building, placing women to the north. Most of the people in the building would have remained standing through the entire service. Benches were provided along the sides only for the elderly and infirm. "

ROZOVO, BULGARIA—A Thracian beehive tomb in central Bulgaria that was looted and damaged in 2010 has been investigated by a team of archaeologists, according to an Archaeology in Bulgaria report. The scientists say this tomb, known as the Rozovo Tomb, is the smallest of the known Thracian brick tombs in the country. Its bricks vary in size and are thought to have been made on the spot to the specifications required by the architect and the builder. “Everything was made to fit together,” said Georgi Nehrizov of the National Institute and Museum of Archaeology in Sofia. He and Meglena Parvin of the Kazanlak Museum of History think the structure dates to the first half of the third century B.C. “This Hellenistic era Thracian brick tomb is the second one after the Kazanlak Tomb to be discovered with a fully preserved dome,” Nehrizov added. Other tombs in the region are not as well preserved, he added, since some of their bricks were reused in later structures. A wooden antechamber in front of the tomb’s main structure had a roof of large, flat tiles and curved tiles, and it had been waterproofed with plaster and river stones. "

Most of the other tombs in Cumae during this period had been painted white and red, without figures, said CNRS researcher Priscilla Munzi. The images in this tomb, however, appear to depict a banquet, complete with a nude servant carrying a jug of wine and a vase. “The theme of the banquet (preparation ceremony) is widespread in the oldest tombs,” Munzi explained. “But this is the first tomb of [the] second century B.C. in Campania that documents this motif.” Anthropological study of bones found in the looted tomb has not been completed, Munzi said. There may have been three occupants, since the tomb was equipped with three beds. Alabaster perfume vases, bone and bronze fittings for a wooden box, and game pieces were also recovered. "

TÜBINGEN, GERMANY—According to a New Scientist report, research conducted by Katerina Harvati of the University of Tübingen and her colleagues suggests Neanderthals were capable of precision grips using finger and thumb. It had been thought Neanderthals were limited to full-fisted grips because their hand bones were generally “chunkier” than those of modern humans. Harvati’s team examined 3-D scans of the points on modern human finger bones where the muscles and tendons attach, known as entheses, in people who worked different kinds of jobs, such as bricklaying, tailoring, and painting, and compared the sizes of their entheses with those of six Neanderthals and six early modern humans. The results indicate that all of the Neanderthals spent much of their time using precision grips, while the early modern humans may have employed a division of labor, since only about half of their finger bones bore the mark of continued precision grips, while the others showed signs of repeated power grips. Harvati said this anatomical evidence supports the archaeological evidence for sophisticated cultural behavior among Neanderthals. "

STIRLING, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that a skeleton has been discovered in the foundation trench of a wall in the remains of a Dominican friary operated by the Blackfriars from A.D. 1233 to 1559. The man’s arms were crossed over his body, which could indicate he was firmly wrapped in a shroud for burial. A bronze buckle and traces of textile found with the bones suggest the man wore a Dominican habit and was therefore a friar himself. Radiocarbon dating suggests the friar lived between A.D. 1271 and 1320, and so may have witnessed local events of the Scottish Wars of Independence, including the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297, and the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Bob Will of Guard Archaeology said the site has also yielded shards of window glass, and what may have been the friary’s kitchen, where historic records indicate the Blackfriars ate imported foods such as figs, raisins, and wine.

Known as the ship in which Captain James Cook traveled to Australia in 1770, Endeavour later served as a prison ship for Americans captured by the British during the War of Independence, and was eventually scuttled with 12 other vessels in 1778 to build a blockade before the Battle of Rhode Island. Kevin Sumption, director of the Australian National Maritime Museum, said divers are gathering samples of timber from five shipwrecks at one site in the Atlantic. At least one of the wrecks is said to be the size of Endeavour’s hull. “Most of the ships that were scuttled in Newport in August 1778 were built of American or Indian timbers [but] the Endeavour was built in the north of England of predominately oak,” Sumption added. If the tests show that one of the vessels was constructed in England, excavation around the wreckage site could produce further evidence of the ships’ identities, such as materials known to have been used on a prison ship.

King Chak Took Ich’aak is known to have ruled the nearby city of El Peru-Waka about 20 years later. “Having information about what happened next, how they were plotting a political strategy here, teaches us a lot about politics in those times and the fight for territory,” Barrientos said.

Nawa Sugiyama of George Mason University and her colleagues analyzed isotopes in the bones and teeth of big cats whose remains were uncovered in five ritual sites in the ancient city. Some of the bones had high levels of C4, a molecule common in agricultural plants, which suggests the cats were fed animals that ate plants raised by humans, and hence that the cats lived in captivity. Other big cat bones had high levels of C3, a molecule found in wild plants, which suggests these animals were killed in the wild. The remains of animals such as deer, owls, spoonbills, and crocodiles were tested as well. Isotope analysis suggests some of these animals originated in distant regions of the Copán Valley. Sugiyama said the Maya practice of trading wild and captured animals for ritual purposes may have been more extensive than previously thought. "

BERGEN, NORWAY—An international team of researchers led by Christopher Henshilwood of the University of Bergen have concluded that the red marks on a small stone fragment recovered from South Africa’s Blombos Cave were made by a human with a piece of ochre some 73,000 years ago, according to a report in The Guardian . Because the six thin lines crossed by three additional lines end abruptly at the edge of the stone, the scientists think they were part of a larger design on a grindstone cobble that helped process ochre rocks into powder used to make paint. Microscopic examination and experimental reproduction of the design revealed that some of narrow the lines had been made with single strokes of an ochre crayon, which must have been hard and pointed, while others were made with a rubbing motion. “When we reproduced the lines, you have to have a very firm hand and have to apply the ochre quite determinedly to make them look like that,” Henshilwood explained. Similar designs have been found in places across the world, including Australia, France, and Spain, he added, but archaeologists do not know what they might have meant to the people who made them. "

LINCOLN, ENGLAND—A medieval sarcophagus dating to the twelfth or thirteenth century has been uncovered at a construction site in England’s East Midlands, according to a Lincolnshire Live report. The sarcophagus was designed to be wider at one end, in order to support a pillow or headdress. A hole in its center would have allowed fluids to drain away from the body. Found next to the stone foundation of a fifteenth-century building, the sarcophagus was surrounded by stones and set level with a cobbled surface. It had probably been moved to the site to serve as a trough for feeding animals, or to process wool or leather. The three holes at its foot end are thought to have been drilled in the fifteenth century in order to speed up drainage for its new purpose. "

The body was found in the basement of a wooden building that had been burned down. Koperkiewicz’s team has also recovered arrowheads, crossbow bolts, silver and bronze ornaments, and fragments of a medieval Christian cross in the well-preserved city. The researchers are still looking for the site of the city’s church, however. Wartenburg’s cemetery has yielded traces of clothing, coins, and pottery. Some of the pottery had been broken, perhaps as a symbol of the fragility of human life, Koperkiewicz said. "

BRADFORD, ENGLAND— UPI reports that scientists led by Julia Beaumont of the University of Bradford analyzed the baby teeth of more than 1,000 Anglo-Saxon children who lived in the Raunds Furnells settlement, a tenth-century site in England’s East Midlands, to see whether evidence of malnourishment could be detected in the remains. They then compared the teeth of children who survived from conception to at least 1,000 days after with those who did not. The researchers found that nutritional stress slowed bone growth, but the dentine in teeth continued to grow, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the child’s diet and health status. Teeth will record high levels of nitrogen, indicating the child was starving, even when bone growth has stopped, Beaumont said. The study could help scientists evaluate risk factors affecting the health of living children, she added. "

Archaeologist Boni Petrunova of Bulgaria’s National Museum of History said the small, light coins reflect the decline of the Second Bulgarian Empire and Byzantium. For example, the 20 hyperpyrons, or late Byzantine gold coins, in the collection had been clipped, or made smaller by shaving metal from their circumference, to such an extent that it was difficult to identify them. Eight Venetian gold coins dating to the mid-fourteenth century were also found in the pot, along with a few coins from Wallachia, a Bulgarian ally to the north, and a single Tatar coin, all of which may have flown through local markets. The objects are thought to have been looted by a Tatar leader who quickly hid his treasure during one of the last Mongol invasions of the region, since there were still threads attached to the buttons, suggesting they had been ripped off a lavish garment in a hurry.

NIEDERSTOTZINGEN, GERMANY— Science Magazine reports that analysis of DNA samples taken from the 1,400-year-old remains of ten Germanic, noble warriors and three children discovered in southern Germany suggests that some of them had been born locally, while others may have originated in different parts of Europe. The study, led by Niall O’Sullivan, now of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, also revealed that at least 11 of the individuals were male—the test results of the remaining two were inconclusive. Overall, five of the individuals in the sample were directly related to each other, but three people who had been buried in the same grave were unrelated. One of them had DNA associated with people from northern, eastern, and central Europe, while the other two had DNA suggesting they were related to people from southern Europe. Analysis of isotopes obtained from their teeth suggests that only one of the two individuals with southern European relatives grew up in the same area as the burial. O’Sullivan and his colleagues wonder whether the Germanic warriors may have welcomed foreigners into their households, or whether it is possible they adopted child hostages for use in intertribal negotiations.

DAWSON CITY, YUKON—A crew building a recreational trail in northwest Canada discovered a cache of 23 Canadian and American coins dating to the nineteenth century, according to a CBC News report. “These are coins that would have been in common circulation during the [Klondike] Gold Rush,” said archaeologist Christian Thomas of the Yukon government. The coins were buried in what was a busy part of Dawson City where day laborers, miners, and service industry workers lived. The oldest of the coins, which have a total face value of $9.50, is dated 1864. Adjusted for inflation, the amount is equivalent to about $240 today, although prices for basic goods could be extremely high. Thomas explained that a pound of butter sold for about five dollars in Dawson City at the time. “A lot of the tax records show that a lot of these properties were foreclosed on,” Thomas said, “so people would stay, they might go visit family, intending to come back [to Dawson], but just never made it back because they didn’t make their big gold strike.” "

When the researchers learned that similar stones, which make a sound when struck, have been found in Europe, they tested the Colorado stones. “I was so amazed because they make a real ringing sound and I couldn’t get over it,” Matorano said. Now other researchers in Colorado are checking museum collections for possible lithophones. “I have a lot of questions that remain, that we still don’t know about,” Matorano added. “Where did they get the rock to make these?

According to a report in The Hackney Citizen , a team from Museum of London Archaeology has uncovered sections of an expansive gravel yard surrounding the polygonal playhouse—built in 1576—where patrons could eat, drink, and socialize during long performances. Artifacts uncovered include a complete Elizabethan goblet, a unique fragment of ceramic depicting a bearded man, and pieces of money boxes used to collect entry fees. The Theatre is believed to have been the first purpose-built theater in London since Roman times. Shakespeare performed there after first arriving in the city as a young man. The venue later hosted many of his iconic works, including Romeo and Juliet, which was staged the mid-1590s when he was resident playwright. In 1598, after losing a lease to the land, Shakespeare's company dismantled the playhouse, moved the timbers across the Thames to Southwark, and built the Globe, which opened in 1599. A new development at the site will include an exhibition center where the public can see the Theatre's foundation remains in situ and view objects unearthed at the site. "

COLOGNE, GERMANY—According to an Associated Press report, a new study suggests that periods of cold, dry climate may have helped modern humans displace Neanderthals from Europe. Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago, just a few thousand years after Homo sapiens arrived in Europe. Scientists have proposed a number of explanations, including an epidemic that targeted Neanderthals and competition for scarce resources. The new study draws on previously available data along with new findings on the ancient climate from two caves in Romania. It focuses on two cold, dry periods: One beginning around 44,000 years ago and lasting 1,000 years, and another beginning around 40,800 years ago and lasting 600 years. Both climate events coincided with the disappearance of Neanderthal artifacts and the appearance of signs of modern humans in sites in the Danube River valley and France. Climate shift would have likely replaced forest with shrub-filled grassland, to which modern humans may have been better adapted than Neanderthals. “Whether they moved or died out, we can’t tell,” said Michael Staubwasser of the University of Cologne in Germany.

SUSSEX, ENGLAND—An experimental study of 500,000-year-old flint hand axes from England's Boxgrove quarry site suggests the tools were crafted by early humans who had anatomically modern human–like hands, according to a report in The Independent . Human finger bones dating back more than 300,000 years are extremely rare in the fossil record, making it difficult to know how well human ancestors were able to manipulate objects. So, Alastair Key of the University of Kent and his team attached sensors to the hands of modern flint knappers in order to measure the grips and strength required to reproduce stone tools using different techniques. The study suggests that a stronger grip would have been necessary to make the highly modified and shaped stone tools found in the Boxgrove quarry than to produce simpler tools. Key said such strong, dexterous hands would have been able to make a wide variety of objects from wood, antler, and bone, too. Human intelligence is thought to have evolved in an interactive process alongside manual dexterity, he added. "

The test results suggest that as many as 49 percent of the people in the sample may have had blue eyes, and many were likely fair-skinned as well. Overall, the people in the study had genomes that were closely related to people who lived in Anatolia and the Zagros Mountains. And, while some of the artifacts and ossuaries in the cave are typical of those found in the southern Levant, others look like they could have been made in the northern regions of the Near East.

SHAANXI, CHINA— Live Science reports that a step pyramid in the Neolithic site known as Shimao has been excavated in northern China by a team of researchers led by Li Jaang of Zhengzhou University, Zhouyong Sun and Jing Shao of the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology, and Min Li of the University of California, Los Angeles. It had been previously thought the structure was part of the Great Wall of China, which was built between 2,700 and 400 years ago. The 4,300-year-old pyramid’s 11 steps were lined with stone. On the top step, some 230 feet high, palaces for the city’s rulers were built with wood and rammed earth. The top step was even equipped with a water reservoir. The pyramid and its surrounding settlement were fortified with ramparts and gates. Six pits containing decapitated human heads were found in the outer rampart. The victims may have been captives from Zhukaigou, a nearby city. "

ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that a stone carved with Pictish symbols has been recovered from the banks of the River Don in northeast Scotland by members of Historic Environment Scotland, Aberdeenshire Council, and the University of Aberdeen. The stone was exposed because the recent drought has lowered the river’s water level. The figures on the stone, made sometime between the sixth and eighth centuries A.D., include a triple disc with a cross bar, a mirror, and a notched rectangle with two internal spirals. Aberdeen archaeologist Bruce Mann said such stones are rare, and the discovery of this stone in the river could help researchers understand how they were used. It has been suggested that the symbols could represent the names of individuals or groups. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/6915-180822-denisovan-neanderthal-girl,Pre-Human,"Genetic Study May Reveal Hominin Interactions. LEIPZIG, GERMANY—According to a BBC News report, analysis of DNA recovered from a 50,000-year-old bone fragment unearthed in Russia’s Denisova Cave suggests that it belonged to a teenage girl who had a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan father. The study also indicates the mother was more closely related to Neanderthal populations in Europe than to the Neanderthals who had previously lived in Denisova Cave, which is located in the Altai Mountains of Siberia. This suggests that Neanderthals migrated between western and eastern Eurasia. The girl’s Denisovan father also had at least one Neanderthal ancestor. Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA) said that Neanderthals and Denisovans may not have had many opportunities to meet, but when they did, they probably mated more frequently than had been previously thought. “Out of this very little number we find one individual that is half-and-half mixed ancestry,” explained Viviane Slon, also of MPI-EVA.

ESSEX, ENGLAND—England’s continuing drought has revealed a path thought to date to the eighteenth century in Hatfield Forest, according to The Dunmow Broadcast . Hatfield Forest, now owned by England’s National Trust, was a royal hunting forest dating back to the medieval period. In the eighteenth century, it was purchased by the wealthy Houblon family, who lived in the adjacent estate. The family added a lake to the center of the forest, which was modified by landscape architect Lancelot Capability Brown in 1757. He also added The Shell House, a picnic room decorated with flints and shells brought back from the West Indies as ballast in slave ships, to the landscaping at the lake. Park ranger Ian Pease said the trail probably served as a carriage route from the estate into the forest to the lake and picnic area. An excavation of areas of the path, led by archaeologist Shannon Hogan, could provide information about how it was constructed and how it has been impacted by the modern walkers who visit the forest.

CAPE BRETON ISLAND, NOVA SCOTIA— The Cape Breton Post reports that a team of excavators led by Amy Scott of the University of New Brunswick and David Ebert of Parks Canada is removing human remains from an eighteenth-century cemetery at the reconstructed Fortress of Louisbourg before the bones erode into the Atlantic Ocean. Built by the French and named for Louis XIV, the fortress was captured by British colonists in 1745, then returned to the French as part of a 1748 treaty ending the War of the Austrian Succession. Captured by the British again in 1758 during the Seven Years’ War, the original fortifications at the site were dismantled by the British, who kept a garrison there until 1768. The cemetery, estimated to hold the remains of 1,000 people, is located on a peninsula known as Rochefort Point, up to half of which is thought to have worn away over the past 300 years. “They may have had tough lives,” Ebert said, “but these people were laid to rest with a great deal of care and affection—in some cases, for example, people would have invested in beautiful shroud pins to enclose the shroud around their loved ones when they are laid to rest.” Scott said examination of the bones will help researchers learn about those who built and lived in the fortress.

STONY BROOK, NEW YORK—According to a report in The Guardian , Elisabeth Hildebrand of Stony Brook University says a 5,000-year-old communal cemetery in northwestern Kenya is evidence that early pastoralists who lived without social hierarchies were able to work together to achieve common goals. At least 580 individuals were buried in a mortuary cavity placed in the center of a platform measuring 90 feet across and marked by pillar-like megaliths at the Lothagam North site. The arrangement of the bodies, Hildebrand said, suggests the men, women, and children were buried without any indication of social ranking, and, she noted, all of them were buried with elaborate personal ornaments. The monument may also have been served as a meeting place to renew ties and exchange information. The burial cavity was eventually filled in and capped with thousands of stones. “We don’t know why or what happened next,” said project co-director Katherine Grillo of the University of Florida. "

HAMILTON, ONTARIO— CNN reports that researchers from McMaster University, Historic England, and the English Heritage Trust examined the remains of children who had been buried in cemeteries ranging from northern England to southern Spain and were surprised to find that more than one in 20 of those who lived between the first and sixth centuries A.D. showed signs of rickets, or weakened bones caused by vitamin D deficiency. The scientists suggest the disease may have resulted from the weaker sunshine in northern Europe, which can make it harder for the body to absorb vitamin D, and the fact that parents in the northern parts of the Roman Empire probably kept their children inside more of the time in an effort to protect them from the cool, cloudy climate. Children who lived near the Mediterranean Sea would have likely been exposed to more sunshine throughout the year, which would have helped to strengthen their bones, unless they lived in crowded apartment buildings, such as those found in the Rome’s seaport of Ostia. Megan Brickley of McMaster University said the small windows, closed-in courtyards, and narrow streets found there could account for the cases of rickets detected in Ostia’s ancient cemetery. "

CAIRO, EGYPT—According to an Ahram Online report, Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, announced that preliminary studies of the three skeletons discovered in a massive granite sarcophagus in Alexandria suggest the bones belonged to a young woman and two men. The woman is thought to have died between the ages of 20 and 25, and stood about five feet, four inches tall. One of the men, who was about as tall as the woman, lived to between 35 and 39 years of age, while the second man died between the ages of 40 and 44, and stood about five feet, eleven inches tall. Zeinab Hashish, director of the Department of Skeleton Remains Studies at the Ministry of Antiquities, said a healed hole in this man’s skull may have been the result of surgical trepanation, which is thought to have been a rare practice in Egypt. The people are thought to have been buried in phases, since the skeletons were stacked inside the sarcophagus. Examination of the contents of the coffin also yielded several small, intricately decorated gold panels, Waziri said. The liquid found inside the granite sarcophagus is thought to be wastewater that seeped into the tomb, but it is undergoing analysis. "

The mural, which consists of images of snakes and human heads carved into an adobe wall, measures about three feet tall and nine feet long, and stands at the entrance to a ceremonial hall. Archaeologist Ruth Shady Solís, director of the Caral excavations, said the four human heads in the mural are shown side-by-side with their eyes closed. The two snakes pass between and around them, with their heads pointed to what may be a humanoid seed symbol digging into the soil. Shady Solís thinks the serpents could represent a water deity who irrigated the earth. The mural may have been created during a drought and subsequent famine, since other reliefs at the site depict emaciated people. "

The tomb belonged to Ptahmes, a government official who was in charge of the ancient city of Memphis and served during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. The cheese—a powdery, whitish mass discovered in one of the jar fragments—is thought to have been covered with a scrap of canvas that was found nearby. Chemical analysis of the substance detected five proteins commonly found in milk from cows, sheep, goats, and buffalo. Two of those proteins only come from cows. The researchers think the “cheese-like product” was made from a mixture of cow’s milk and the milk of either sheep or goats. The scientists also identified a protein associated with Brucella melitensis , a bacterium that causes the disease brucellosis, which is characterized by fever, nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

YORK, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that an international team of researchers including Stephen Buckley of the University of York has worked out an ancient Egyptian embalming “recipe” through the analysis of a human mummy dated to approximately 3600 B.C. It had been previously thought that this mummy had been formed through natural processes, but chemical analysis of its wrappings revealed the body was intentionally embalmed. The remains, housed in The Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, and never treated by conservators, had been treated with a plant oil such as sesame oil; a “balsam-type” plant or root extract, perhaps derived from bulrushes; a plant-based gum that may have been produced from acacia; and a conifer tree resin, probably from pine trees. When combined with oil, the resin possessed antibacterial properties that helped to protect the body from decay, Buckley said. This basic recipe was used 2,000 years later to embalm the pharaohs, he added, suggesting there was an Egyptian identity long before the Egyptian nation-state was formed. "

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK— Science Nordic reports than an international team of researchers is translating previously unpublished ancient Egyptian texts in the collections of the University of Copenhagen. Egyptologist Kim Ryholt said the topics of the works include medicine, botany, astronomy, and astrology, and are likely to contribute to scholars’ understanding of the history of science, since Egyptian ideas spread to Greece, Rome, and the Middle East. The kidneys, eye diseases, and pregnancy are among the topics covered in medical texts investigated by the researchers so far. One 3,500-year-old papyrus prescribes a method of determing the sex of an unborn child. “The text says that a pregnant woman should pee into a bag of barley and a bag of wheat,” explained Sofie Schiødt of the University of Copenhagen. “Depending on which bag sprouts first reveals the sex of her child. And if neither of the bags sprout then she wasn’t pregnant.” A similar pregnancy test has been found in German folklore dated to 1699. “That really puts things into perspective,” Schiødt said, “as it shows that the Egyptian ideas have left traces thousands of years later.” "

Such crosses were designed to be worn on the chest, suspended by a chain, and are now worn as a symbol of a bishop’s rank. This cross, dated from the tenth to twelfth centuries A.D., may have held relics of a saint. Ovcharov thinks the well-worn cross may have been worn for more than 100 years, since the faces of its figures are worn off. "

The study suggests early hominins, beginning with Ardipithecus ramidus some 4.4 million years ago, would have been able to walk upright while still having an opposable big toe for climbing and grasping. The scientists found that hominin feet changed slowly and were versatile, with the modern big toe—and the commitment to upright walking—emerging later than other modern foot features. “It might have been last because it was the hardest to change,” Fernandez said.

BRISTOL, ENGLAND— Science Magazine reports that biochemists Mélanie Roffet-Salque and Richard Evershed of the University of Bristol and their colleagues analyzed the residues on pottery from the site of Çatalhöyük, which is located in central Turkey, for clues to how a shift in the climate some 8,200 years ago might have affected early farmers. The scientists speculated that drought could have damaged crops and grazing lands, while cooler weather could have increased the food needs of the farmers’ sheep, goats, and cattle. A technique called gas chromatography–mass spectrometry revealed that the fat residues on the pottery dating to the time of the climate shift contained about nine percent more heavy hydrogen—an isotope that correlates with lower levels of precipitation—than sherds from other periods. The researchers also note the higher number of cut marks on animal bones beginning about 8,200 years ago, suggesting that the farmers ate every morsel of available food, and a drop in the number of cattle bones and a rise in the number of goat bones. Goats may have been better at surviving in drought conditions. "

Shipton explained that tools found at the site of a Homo erectus camp near the town of Saffaqah, which is about 175 miles west of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, were made from rocks sourced at a nearby outcrop that may even have rolled into camp. “We also found that in the technology they were using to make the stone tools, they were very conservative,” Shipton said. “They used the same strategies for making the tools in the face of changing environments.” As the local rivers dried up and the environment turned to desert, Shipton thinks the Homo erectus living in the camp may have been unable to plan ahead, and were perhaps reluctant to travel to pursue new water sources. “They would be just planning just a few hours, perhaps a day ahead at most, whereas Homo sapiens and Neanderthals [did] things like target seasonal migration,” he added.

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND—According to an Associated Press report , a new genetic analysis of 1,000-year-old walrus skulls in European museum collections suggests at that at least 80 percent of them were imported from Norse settlements in Greenland. Walrus tusks were used to produce luxury items such as ivory crucifixes, knife handles, dice, and chess sets for Europe’s medieval elite. But because museum officials have been reluctant to allow scientists to take samples of medieval artifacts for testing, the source of the ivory was unknown. James Barrett of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues found 23 walrus tusks that were still attached to pieces of skull in museum collections around Europe, and collected samples of the bones for the investigation. The researchers now think a collapse in the European market for ivory, brought on by the Black Death and other factors, may have triggered the downfall of the Norse settlements, rather than the cooler climate of the Little Ice Age, as had been previously thought.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6884-180808-roman-emperor-assassination,Roman,"Can the Assassination of Roman Emperors Be Linked to Drought?. ONTARIO, CANADA—Economic historian Cornelius Christian of Brock University thinks the assassinations of Roman emperors could be linked to decreased rainfall and lack of food for the Roman military, according to a Live Science report. Christian compared ancient climate data collected in a previous study from fossilized tree rings in France and Germany—the Roman frontier—with records of mutinies and emperor assassinations. If local farmers could not produce enough food, he reasoned, hungry Roman soldiers could have been pushed into mutiny. “And that mutiny, in turn, would collapse support for the emperor and make him more prone to assassination,” Christian said. He pointed to the death of emperor Vitellius in A.D. 69 as an example. “Vitellius was an acclaimed emperor by his troops,” he explained. “Unfortunately, low rainfall hit that year, and he was completely flabbergasted. His troops revolted, and eventually he was assassinated in Rome.” Critics of the idea say the correlation of drought and assassination merits more research, but note the influence of inflation, disease, and war on the stability of the Roman Empire.

The first ax, the largest found so far at the site, showed signs of heavy use. Site director Nick Card of the University of the Highlands and Islands said the tool may have been damaged while cutting timber joists for a building with a characteristic stone-slab roof. The second ax had been shaped to maximize the beauty of the stone’s natural colors. It also showed signs of wear and tear from use, and may have even been used as an anvil, since it is covered in peck marks. Card explained that the second ax had been placed opposite the entrance of the structure in which it was found. The building was aligned to catch the equinox sunrise. He thinks axes may have served as symbols of power, in addition to multifunctional tools. "

CLUJ-NAPOCA, ROMANIA—According to a Romania-Insider report, a team of researchers led by Rüdiger Krause of Goethe University and Florin Gogâltan of the Institute of Archaeology and History of Art of the Romanian Academy have discovered an ancient citadel made of wood and clay in western Romania. Called the “Old Citadel,” or Cetatea Veche, the structure covered some 220 acres and is thought to have been one of the largest and more impressive fortifications built in the area during the Bronze Age. So far, the team members have found a palace measuring more than 300 feet long and 130 feet wide within the citadel. “Our purpose is to find out why this fortification was made, why the construction was needed,” Krause explained."

COUNTY OFFALY, IRELAND—According to a report in The Irish Times , heat wave conditions in Europe have revealed the outlines of former structures at Birr Castle, located in Ireland’s Midlands Region. The castle is well known as the home of the “Great Telescope,” or “Leviathan of Parsonstown,” which was built in 1845 by the third Earl of Rosse. It remained the largest telescope in the world for 75 years. The outlines revealed in the grass include paths taken by astronomers from Birr Castle’s main gate to the telescope. Portions of the so-called Black Castle, which fell into ruin on the site in the early seventeenth century, can also be seen in the scorched grass. Scholars were aware the structure existed, but did not know not exactly where it stood. The scorch marks suggest the Black Castle’s main gate was located where the main hall of today’s Birr Castle now stands. "

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Washington Post , analysis of sediments from Mexico’s Lake Chichancanab has quantified the severity of the drought that has been linked to the collapse of Maya civilization. Scientists from the University of Cambridge and the University of Florida developed a geochemical technique to measure the levels of the different isotopes of “fossil water” trapped in crystals of the mineral gypsum found in the lake’s layers of sediment. Lighter isotopes of water would have evaporated more quickly, leaving behind higher proportions of heavier isotopes of water in the gypsum, depending upon the length of the drought. The study indicates there was a 50 percent decrease in annual precipitation between A.D. 800 and 1000, rising to as much as a 70 percent drop at times. “Drought does have the potential to be a driving force for a lot of the issues that can cause civilization stress,” said Nick Evans of the University of Cambridge.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6839-180803-indonesia-flores-genes,Pre-Human,"No Link Found Between “Hobbits” and Modern Flores Population. PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY— BBC News reports that a new genetic study led by Serena Tucci of Princeton University suggests the small-statured people who live on the Indonesian island of Flores today evolved separately from Homo floresiensis —the small-sized hominin known as the “Hobbit,” whose fossils were discovered in the island's Liang Bua Cave some 15 years ago. It had been previously thought that Flores' ancient population might have mixed with Homo sapiens when the latter arrived on the island thousands of years ago, producing the ancestors of the modern so-called pygmy population. Tucci explained that, because scientists have not been able to recover “Hobbit” DNA from the fossils, the team members employed a statistical method to look for ancient DNA in the modern Flores population. The researchers found traces of Neanderthal and Denisovan ancestry, but no “chunks” of DNA of unknown origin. They did, however, identify gene variants associated with short stature, which also occur in other current Homo sapiens groups, and genes associated with plant-based diets. Since smaller individuals have lower energy requirements, they may have been better adapted to survive on the poor diet available on the island. “Together, the evidence makes it unlikely that the pygmies are in any way derived from Hobbits,” concluded team member Richard Green of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

ORKNEY, SCOTLAND—A new theory proposes that Neolithic burials in Orkney and Shetland may contain the bodies of tsunami victims, according to a BBC News report. The theory is based on clear evidence of tsunamis that occurred in the Solomon Islands and Vanuata, in the southern hemisphere, around the same time the burials date to, just over 5,000 years ago. Evidence of a tsunami that occurred around this time has been found at Garth Loch, South Nesting in Shetland, but no such evidence has been found in Orkney. “The question is, is it at all possible that even a single body in [the mass burials] might have drowned? And, if so, when did that drowning take place?” says James Goff of the University of South Wales. “And is it indeed possible that it is indeed linked to the Garth tsunami?” Archaeologists who have excavated in Orkney are skeptical of the theory. They point out that the mass burial sites do not show signs of having been constructed in haste and that they appear to have been built over a span of hundreds of years, and as such could not have been the result of a single event.

OXFORD, ENGLAND—At least some of the people buried at Stonehenge appear to have come from near the Preseli Hills in west Wales where the bluestones used to build the Neolithic monument were quarried, according to a report from The Guardian . Testing of strontium isotopes from the cremated skull fragments buried at the monument showed that at least 10 of 25 individuals represented had come from at least 100 miles away, including the area near the Preseli Hills. It’s not clear that the bones belonged to those who built the monument, but the earliest cremation dates—around 3000 B.C.—are close to when the bluestones that formed the first circle at Stonehenge were transported there. “The earliest dates are tantalizingly close to the date we believe the bluestones arrived, and though we cannot prove they are the bones of the people who brought them, there must at least be a relationship,” said archaeologist John Pouncett of the University of Oxford. “The range of dates raises the possibility that for centuries people could have been brought to Stonehenge for burial with the stones.” The pieces of skull were found in a circle of 56 pits outside the stone circle that also contained bluestone chips and may have held the original circle of bluestones, which were then rearranged over the succeeding centuries.

ARICA, CHILE—According to a Live Science report, a new study of a fifteenth-century grave in northern Chile has detected the presence of cinnabar, a highly toxic, fine-grained red pigment derived from mercury ore. Discovered in the 1970s, the grave of the Cerro Esmeralda mummies contained the remains of a young woman around the age of 18, and an approximately nine-year-old girl. The two are thought to have been killed in a ritual Inca sacrifice, before their bodies had been placed in the fetal position in the grave, along with more than 100 artifacts. Fabric in the grave was colored with bright-red pigment, which the Inca usually produced using the mineral hematite. Use of cinnabar among the Inca has been linked to high social status, but the scientists, led by Bernardo Arriaza of Chile’s Universidad de Tarapacá, do not yet know where this cinnabar came from or why it was used. They did note that the mineral has toxic effects on human health, however, pointing out that nervous, muscular, and gastrointestinal problems, and even death, can occur when the mineral powder is inhaled. The Inca may have scattered the red powder over their ceremonial burial sites in order to deter grave robbers, the researchers suggested. "

PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND—It had been previously believed that the ancient Dorset and Thule peoples of the Arctic learned to spin yarn from the Vikings who arrived in Newfoundland some 1,000 years ago, but according to a Canadian Press report, new radiocarbon dates suggest that pieces of yarn recovered from Baffin Island and the Ungava Peninsula could be much older. Gorill Nilsen of Tromsø University developed a way to cleanse the Arctic fibers of the seal and whale oils that had made them impossible to radiocarbon date in the past. The new tests indicate the pieces of yarn were crafted by Arctic peoples between 500 and 1,000 years before the Norse arrived in the New World. “There’s a lot we don’t know,” said Michele Hayeur Smith of Brown University. But she pointed out that the Arctic yarns do not resemble those made by the Vikings. “The idea that you would have to learn to spin something from another culture was a bit ludicrous,” she said. “It’s a pretty intuitive thing to do.” "

CHICHESTER, ENGLAND—According to a BBC News report, archaeologists have uncovered a private bath at one of two townhouses discovered in southeast England. The bath, made of bricks, tiles, and mortar, would have been large enough to hold four people. “It would have been filled with really hot water, and for the owner to be able to use the bathhouse throughout the year, it would have required staggering amounts of charcoal for the furnace, and a considerable amount of tending and stoking to keep it going,” said Chichester District Council archaeologist James Kenny. The bath is thought to have been supplied with water from a main supply accessible only to the wealthiest people in the city. "

COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA—Archaeologist Michael Scafuri of The Hunley Project announced that the levers controlling the keel blocks on the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley were still locked in the regular position, according to an Associated Press report. Corrosion, silt, and shells have accumulated on Hunley since it disappeared in Charleston Harbor shortly after its crew of eight placed explosives on the hull of USS Housatonic , a ship in the Union blockading squadron. Scientists have been carefully removing concretions from the inside and outside of the vessel and looking for possible clues as to why it sank. Scafuri explained that releasing the 1,000-pound keel blocks, which helped to keep the hand-cranked vessel upright while underwater, would have helped the Hunley crew to surface quickly in the case of an emergency. “It’s more evidence there wasn’t much of a panic on board,” he added.

ÖLAND, SWEDEN— Science Nordic reports that a team of underwater archaeologists from Södertörn University, the Västervik Museum, and other organizations recently found human remains, cannons, and a hand grenade while investigating the wreckage of the Swedish warship Mars . Discovered in 2011 off the coast of Öland Island, Mars sank in the deep waters of the Baltic Sea in 1564 after a violent gunpowder explosion while under attack during the Northern Seven Years’ War, fought between Denmark and Sweden from 1563 to 1570. “We can see from the wreckage that it was a very intense and tough battle,” said researcher Rolf Fabricius Warming. The human remains include a femur bearing trauma on the knee end that may have been caused by a sharp-edged weapon. Historical sources indicate Mars had a large anti-boarding net covering its deck, but the net failed to prevent as many as 400 Danish and Lübeckian soldiers from jumping aboard the ship and attacking the crew. Large guns, another recent innovation at the time, had been intended to engage the enemy at long distance, also in an effort to prevent such close-quarter fighting. “Soldiers fought with hand grenades, lances, and spears, which they threw down from the masts,” Warming explained. “The fighting was structured and carefully calculated, but an absolute ruckus.” "

A wooden bowl and pegs were found protected by damp silt in the same chamber earlier this month. Martin Carruthers of the University of the Highlands and Islands said the hair looks like human hair, and is still pliable and shiny. Measuring about three inches long, it could potentially record about eight months’ worth of information on the person’s diet and health. “We have recovered some human remains from the site in the past, such as a mandible and the odd tooth, but nothing as exciting as the hair which [has] enormous potential to give us a more vivid picture of the humanity of the broch,” Carruthers said.

LEIDEN, THE NETHERLANDS—According to a report in The Los Angeles Times , Neanderthals may have controlled and produced fire as early as 50,000 years ago. Andrew Sorensen of Leiden University struck a piece of pyrite against a replica biface—a palm-sized multipurpose tool used by Neanderthals—to see if he could start a fire with it. “Some strikes produced only one spark, others produced showers of up to ten sparks or so,” he said. Sorensen then employed a microscope to compare the marks left on the replica biface with those recovered from several Neanderthal sites in France, and found that they were similar. Bifaces are also thought to have been used to butcher and skin animals, grind minerals into powder, and create other tools, so Sorensen used his replica biface in these ways as well in order to determine what sort of marks these actions left on the stone. “The traces made by pyrite were the ‘best fit,’” he said. “But there could be some other mineral material that we just didn’t think of that could create similar traces.” "

The coins were all minted in Caesarea, which is located about 600 miles away, between the reigns of Hadrian, who ruled in the early second century A.D., and Septimius Severus, who ruled at the beginning of the third century A.D. “All coins were found very close to each other in the Roman fort [of] Apsaros,” said Radosław Karasiewicz-Szczypiorski of the University of Warsaw. He and Shota Mamuladze of Batumi Shota Rustaveli State University think the coins may have been part of a larger treasure possibly hidden by Roman soldiers before their expedition against the Parthians. The treasure may have been scattered by later earthworks and construction at the site of the fort by Byzantine, Ottoman, and Soviet soldiers. "

About half of the graves have been exhumed, and more than 20 of the bodies have been analyzed. All but one of them were men who lived to between the ages of about 14 to 70. The bones show evidence of poor childhood health and heavy labor. Some of them may have been former slaves. Ken Brown of the University of Houston thinks the men may have been African-American laborers who worked at the sugar plantation under a convict lease system. In other words, they were prisoners of the state of Texas, often arrested for minor offenses such as loitering, who were forced to live and work on the plantation. Eventually, Texas had state-run prison farms, Brown said. Prisoners helped to build the Texas state capitol building in Austin, as well as part of the Texas State Railroad. "

After examining the bones from ten of the graves, the researchers were able to classify just five of the dead as three women and two children. The size and build of the bones suggests they may have been Normans from northern France, who conquered the island in addition to parts of southern Italy. “In the second half of the eleventh century, the island was recaptured from the Arabs by a Norman nobleman, Roger de Hauteville,” Moździoch explained. The church, which resembles those found in Western Europe, is also thought to have been built at this time, at a strategic location on a hill. Coins minted in Champagne and Lucca have been discovered within it. "

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK— The Guardian reports that archaeologist Amaia Arranz-Otaegui of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues have found charred crumbs of bread baked 14,000 years ago by Natufian hunter-gatherers living in northeast Jordan. It had been previously believed that bread was first produced by early farmers. Among the more than 600 charred, bread-like lumps found in a fireplace, the excavation uncovered small tubers from a wetland plant, legumes, wild wheat and barley, and plants belonging to the cabbage family. Analysis of some of the lumps suggest they were made from barley, einkorn wheat or oats, and sometimes other plants. The flour used to make them may have even be sieved. The dough is thought to have been baked in the fire’s ashes, or on a hot stone, to produce an unleavened flat bread. Team member Tobias Richter said such a bread would have been very labor intensive to produce, and so was probably not a staple in the Natufian diet. This bread may have been consumed as part of a large feast or ritual event—since the fireplace also contained the bones of gazelles, water birds, and hares—or may have been prepared as provisions for a journey.

BASEL, SWITZERLAND—According to a Live Science report, a wad of 2,000-year-old papyrus from the collections of the University of Basel has been restored and translated, revealing a previously unknown composition. An examination of the papyrus with ultraviolet and infrared light revealed the sheets may have been stuck together, possibly to be reused as a bookbinding. Once a restorer separated the wad into individual sheets, the Greek text could be read. Ancient historian Sabine Huebner explained the papyrus bears a medical text that may have been composed by the Roman physician Galen, who lived from A.D. 130 to 210. The text may also comprise a commentary on Galen's work, describing a phenomenon he called “hysterical apnea.” Women afflicted with this so-called condition did not suffer from a “wandering womb,” as was thought by other physicians of the day, Galen is known to have argued, but from “hysterical suffocation,” brought on by a lack of intercourse. “The majority of papyri are documents such as letters, contracts, and receipts,” Huebner said. “This is a literary text, however, and they are vastly more valuable.” "

One of the burials consists of a badly damaged wooden coffin containing a mummy wearing a gilded silver mask, thought to have belonged to the second priest of Mut. “Very few masks of precious metals have been preserved to the present day, because the tombs of most ancient Egyptian dignitaries were looted in ancient times,” said Ramadan Hussein of the German-Egyptian archaeological mission that conducted the excavation. The workshop held embalmer’s tools, including pottery vessels and measuring cups. Traces of oils used in the mummification process during the 26th Dynasty may be found on the jars. “We are in front of a gold mine of information about the chemical composition of these oils,” Hussein explained. Fragments of mummy cartonnages, canopic cylindrical jars, and marl clay and faience cups were also recovered. "

Researchers led by Martin Carruthers of the University of the Highlands and Islands think the bowl may have been placed there before the broch was sealed and abandoned. “In appearance, the bowl is similar in shape to certain of the pottery vessels of the period,” Carruthers said. The bowl’s round base suggests it may have been passed from person to person, similar to the way a traditional alcoholic drink is passed in a wooden vessel at weddings in Orkney today. The excavation of the chamber also uncovered what could be woven plant fibers, and two other wooden objects that look like pegs or stakes."

Previous excavations in this area of the city have uncovered huge terrace walls that could have supported a monumental building, as well as a military shield, ivory from a piece of furniture, and a stone seal. “These pieces make our predictions stronger that this area was the field of a palace,” said lead archaeologist Nicholas Dunlop. Now, nearly 50 arrowheads have been found spread over different areas of the possible palace structure. “We also found pots, cooking bowls, and a piece of floor,” he added. “We found three arrowheads in this floor.

The burials were looted at some point, but the researchers think the robbers used a different entrance to the cave and left the skull in its original position. As the researchers explain in a paper in the International Journal of Paleopathology , examination of the skull revealed it had belonged to a woman who died between the ages of 35 and 50. Her cause of death was cancer that the researchers suspect originated in her breasts and then spread to her skull, leaving 14 holes in it. Miccichè suggested that the distinctive markings on her bones may have led to the unusual placement of her skull. The woman’s role in the community during her life may also have been a factor, he added. "

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6782-180711-evolution-african-multiregionalism,Paleolithic,"New Thoughts on Human Evolution. JENA, GERMANY—According to a report in The Atlantic , an international team of scientists led by archaeologist Eleanor Scerri of the University of Oxford argues that modern humans arose in different locations in Africa at different times, in a process called “African multiregionalism.” These groups of human ancestors are thought to have developed in isolation from each other, separated by geographical barriers, until climate change restructured the landscape and brought them together, and then eventually pulled them apart again. This model resembles a river braided together by many streams weaving into and out of each other, rather than an evolutionary tree with one trunk and many branches. For example, fossils from South Africa and Ethiopia, dating back 300,000 years, exhibit a complex mix of archaic and modern features. “People back then looked more different to each other than any populations do today,” Scerri explained, “and it’s very hard to answer what an early Homo sapiens looked like. But there was then a continent-wide trend to the modern human form.” Stone tools and other artifacts support this interpretation of the fossil record, she adds. The trend toward more sophisticated tools and other items is found across Africa, beginning about 300,000 years ago, and has not been traced to one region or one time period. "

The bones were recovered from four archaeological sites around the Strait of Gibraltar and one on the coast of northwest Spain, several of which have been linked to Roman fish-salting and the making of Roman fish sauce. Three of the bones were identified as the bones of grey whales, which disappeared from the North Atlantic in the eighteenth century A.D. and are now only found in the northern Pacific Ocean. As many as three of the bones in the study were identified as North Atlantic right whale bones. Right whales used to breed off the northern coast of Spain, but are now only found in the Western North Atlantic. The study suggests these slower-moving whales may have once traveled the Mediterranean Sea as well, where they would have been easily accessible to the fishermen of the Roman Empire. "

A study of dogs’ nuclear DNA also supports the idea that ancient North American dogs were genetically distinct from today’s animals, but related to Arctic breeds like Alaskan malamutes and Siberian huskies. Evolutionary geneticist Laurent Frantz of the University of Oxford suggests the rate of genetic mutation indicates ancient North American dogs and ancient Siberian dogs shared an ancestor some 16,000 years ago, or about the time when humans were migrating into North America. Dogs may have traveled to the New World with humans, or they may have crossed the land bridge from Siberia into North America on their own at a later date, but before the land bridge disappeared some 11,000 years ago. Zooarchaeologist Angela Perri of Durham University said the first North American dogs were likely wiped out by diseases brought to the New World by the dogs of European explorers, or may have been killed off by wary Europeans who were frightened by their wolf-like appearance.

HANOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE—According to a Live Science report, a study of DIK-1-1, the remains of a three-year-old Australopithecus afarensis individual discovered in Dikika, Ethiopia, suggests that she had a grasping big toe that probably helped her hold onto her mother and even climb trees some 3.3 million years ago. Paleoanthropologist Jeremy DeSilva of Dartmouth College and his colleagues said the toddler’s two-inch long foot resembles the feet of modern humans, except for the curved big toe. “So, it’s human-like in not sticking out to the side, but it had much more mobility and could probably wiggle and grab on to stuff,” DeSilva said. “Not [as well as] a chimp, but certainly more than a human could.” And, adult A. afarensis fossils, such as Lucy, have robust heel bones similar to those possessed by modern humans for upright walking. Selam, however, has a small, delicate heel, which suggests she may have spent more time aloft than her parents, perhaps to avoid large predators. "

ROME, ITALY—A cache of coins dating to the third century B.C. has been found at the Poggetto Mengarelli necropolis at the Vulci archaeological site, located near the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea, according to a report in ANSA . The 15 large bronze coins bear images of the god Janus Bifrons on one side and the prow of a boat on the other, representing the passage to the underworld from the world of the living. They are thought to have been stored in a leather bag, and then placed in the burial along with ceramics and an iron tool called a strigil that was used to clean the body. A coin similar to those in the bag was placed near a bronze clasp on the left shoulder of a man who was buried in the tomb. An iron object that may have been a spear was found near his head. The second person buried in the tomb had been cremated, and the remains wrapped in a shroud that had probably been closed with the bronze clasp found nearby. A small circular pyx, or chalice, with a lead cover was discovered in the tomb’s vestibule. "

NAPLES, ITALY— The New York Times reports that archaeologists have recovered the intact skull and upper body bones of the man whose lower skeleton was found protruding from a large rock door jamb at Pompeii last month. It had been assumed that the rock sitting on his upper body had crushed him to death during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Further excavation has revealed that his lower body had been merely separated from his upper body, which was found about three feet directly below the rest of his remains. This may have happened sometime between 1748 and 1815, when early archaeologists digging tunnels at the site could have caused a collapse in the ash. “Our new hypothesis is that he died from asphyxiation from the pyroclastic flow,” said Massimo Osanna, director of Pompeii Archaeological Park. The walls of the nearby building may have collapsed on the body during the eruption or sometime later. The excavation has also uncovered a small sack containing an iron key, about 20 silver coins, and two bronze coins. "

NORTHUMBERLAND, ENGLAND—A sold bronze hand has been unearthed in a boggy area near the Roman fort of Vindolanda, located at Hadrian’s Wall, according to a report in The Independent . The five-pound hand is thought to have been ritually buried as a gift to the god Jupiter Dolichenus after the Roman victory over Scotland in A.D. 209–210, when Emperor Septimius Severus led 50,000 troops against the Scottish tribes, who the Romans accused of violating a peace agreement. The battle is remembered for its extreme violence and loss of life. The hand is associated with the military deity, who originated in the Middle East as a Syrian version of Jupiter, the Roman king of the gods. The Roman military is known to have mounted such bronze hands on the top of a pole and used it to bestow blessings. In fact, a temple dedicated to Jupiter Dolichenus within the fort at Vindolanda is the only known temple within a fort in the Roman Empire. Andrew Birley, director of the Vindolanda excavations, explained that the hand “is further evidence illustrating how deeply religious [the Roman soldiers] were and how seriously they took their relationship with their god.” "

SUFFOLK, ENGLAND— The Guardian reports that a 4,300-year-old wooden trackway was discovered in eastern England during the construction of a wind farm. A 4,800-year-old causewayed enclosure and a later ring ditch were also found nearby. Situated on a slope near a river, the wooden path appears to have led to a level platform, also made of timber, surrounded by the spring water that preserved the wood. “Some of the wood is so well preserved we can clearly see markings made by an apprentice, before a more experienced tradesman has taken over to complete the job,” said Richard Newman of Wardell Armstrong. Archaeologists think the objects recovered during the excavation, such as pieces of metal, pottery, and an aurochs skull, had been dropped into the water from the platform in some form of ritual activity. The massive cattle skull, which was about 2,000 years old when it was submerged, had been modified in a way that suggests it had been affixed to a pole or was part of a headdress. Masses of white pebbles that appear to have been carried to the site were also recovered. In the eleventh century, the site was covered over and leveled off, which buried the springs and helped preserve the timbers. "

The artwork, dating from A.D. 250 to 900, included murals, ceramic paintings, and carvings depicting market exchanges and tribute payments to Maya kings. “They are collecting way more cacao than the palace actually consumes,” archaeologist Joanne Baron of the Bard Early College Network said of the tribute payments. She thinks the surplus cacao was used to pay palace workers, or to purchase additional goods in the markets. Other goods, such as woven cloth, maize, and green stones may also have been used as money by the Maya during the Classic Period. "

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA— The Guardian reports that historians have identified a likely image of a cockatoo in a thirteenth-century Latin manuscript written by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, making it the earliest known European depiction of the bird, which lives in the wild in northern Australia, New Guinea, and the islands around New Guinea. The book, The Art of Hunting with Birds , contains more than 900 illustrations of birds and falconers. The cockatoo is depicted four times, and is thought to have been sketched from a bird given to Frederick II by al-Kamil, the sultan of Egypt, to add to his extensive menagerie of exotic animals. “The fact that a cockatoo either from the northern tip of Australia, or from New Guinea or the islands around it, was traded to Cairo and on to Sicily is significant,” said Heather Dalton, a University of Melbourne historian. “It’s a window in on what I think was quite a vibrant trading network.” Several years ago, Dalton identified an image of a cockatoo in a fifteenth-century European altarpiece. Finnish researchers then contacted her to let her know about the cockatoo's appearance in Frederick II’s sketches, which are 250 years older. "

PENSACOLA, FLORIDA—Researchers led by Adrianne Walker of the University of West Florida are looking for traces of the plantation house and a slave cabin at what is now the Arcadia Mill archaeological site in northwest Florida, according to a WUWF report. In the nineteenth century, the site consisted of a homestead and an industrial complex made up of a sawmill, a lumber mill with planing and lathing machines, a pail factory, a shingle mill, a textile mill, a silk operation, and a railroad. The house was erected by Ezekiel Simpson, owner of the mill, on a series of brick piers overlooking the industrial complex in 1835. “We’ve never uncovered a brick pier yet; we’ve only found brick walls and so I don’t even know what they look like,” Walker said. The excavation has revealed evidence of water deposits that could be evidence of the drip line for the house before gutters were installed around 1900. The team has also uncovered evidence of a double chimney at a cabin site, and a root cellar. “And, in excavating it,” Walker said, “we found a big iron concretion, about fist size, with turtle shell fragments sitting on top of it.” Conservation and cleaning of the item could help researchers determine how it was used.

Carbonized, germinated grains, dated to between A.D. 400 and 600, were found near several ovens in an area without living quarters, suggesting the people of the settlement reserved the space for the large-scale production of malt. The grains would have been soaked in water so that they would germinate and produce fermentable sugars, then dried at low temperatures in the ovens. Larsson says processing grains into malt in this way is indicative of beer brewing. The beer produced at Uppåkra may have been used for feasting and trade. "

DEIR EL-BHARI, EGYPT— Science in Poland reports that depictions of secretary birds have been identified in the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahari by Filip Taterka of the Polish Academy of Sciences. There are two images of the bird of prey, also known as Sagittarius serpentarius , on the walls of the temple’s upper Portico of Punt, among other images of ebony, gold, resins, ivory, leopards and leopard skins, cheetahs, and giraffes given to the Egyptians by the people of Punt. “It was long thought that a bird that was difficult to identify was a crane, because at this spot the ornament was in poor condition—only the rump was visible,” Taterka said. He found a second image of a bird with a large body with long legs, a short, sharp beak, and distinct feathers on its head on an adjacent block. Three ornithologists have agreed with Taterka’s identification. The new information offers a clue to where the so-called “Land of Punt” may have been located. In the past, scholars have suggested the mysterious place was in Africa or the Arabian Peninsula, but the secretary bird lives only in Africa. “It is not without significance that today the secretary bird is the main element of the emblem of Sudan—perhaps the land of Punt should be sought in southern Sudan or neighboring coastal regions,” he said.

MAINZ, GERMANY—According to an AFP report, analysis of 120,000-year-old deer bones suggests that Neanderthals used weapons and hunting strategies requiring careful planning, cooperation, and concealment. Sabine Gaudzinski-Windheuser of Johannes Gutenberg University and her colleagues used microscopic imaging and ballistics experiments to investigate the pronounced damage that had been inflicted on the bones. The tests indicate that at least one of the blows had been made with a wooden spear at low velocity—in other words, the spear most likely had been thrust into the animal from an underhand angle. In fact, similar wooden staves dated to between 300,000 and 400,000 years ago have been found in England and Germany, but scholars were not sure how Neanderthals may have used them. “As far as spear use is concerned, we now finally have the ‘crime scene’ fitting to the proverbial ‘smoking gun,’” Gaudzinski-Windheuser said.

The researchers detected just six cases of cancer through lesions and bone damage on the skeletons, including a toddler who had leukemia, and a man in his 50s whose rectal cancer tumor was preserved in his mummified remains. A woman who had a hole in her hip bone measuring about 2.5 inches is also thought to have suffered from a tumor, but scientists are not able to determine where the disease originated in her body. Three people—two women and one man—who died in their 20s or 30s are also thought to have succumbed to cancer. Molto and Sheldrick suggest they were infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), an ancient virus known to cause cancer in young people. The study suggests the rate of cancer was much lower than it is today, even though some of the ancient Egyptians buried in the Dakhleh Oasis may have had cancer without it having left marks on their bones.

JENA, GERMANY— Cosmos reports that an international team of researchers has reconstructed three full genomes from historic samples of Treponema pallidum , the bacteria that causes syphilis and yaws. Five bone samples were obtained from seventeenth-century remains of infants interred at Mexico’s convent of Santa Isabel. All of the bones were damaged from infection, but the bacteria was recovered in only three of the samples. Two contained the subspecies that causes syphilis, and one contained the subspecies that causes yaws. The analysis suggests the two subspecies had mixed and recombined DNA, which may have affected its virulence. It has long been thought that syphilis was carried from the New World and introduced to the Old World in the late fifteenth century by Columbus’s crew and other early European explorers. But some scientists now think bone lesions found in older remains in the Old World could be signs of treponemal diseases, and not just leprosy, as had been previously thought. The late-fifteenth-century outbreak of syphilis in Europe may have been caused by a virulent New World strain, the researchers suggest, or it may have been brought on by urbanization and close living quarters. The newly mapped genomes should help researchers investigate the causes of bone lesions in Old World individuals who died before Columbus made his journey. "

SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA— Science Magazine reports that geneticist Alysson Muotri of the University of California, San Diego, led a group of scientists who combined the study of ancient DNA, the editing of genomes with CRISPR, and building “organoids” from stem cells to create what they call “Neanderoids.” The researches swapped one protein-coding gene from the Neanderthal genome into human stem cells that grew into pea-sized masses resembling the cortex, or outer layer of the brain. When compared to brain organoids made with only modern human DNA, the neuronal cells in the Neanderoids migrate more quickly as they form structures, the Neanderoid neurons appear to have an abnormal neuronal network, and the individual Neanderoids appear have a “popcorn” shape, while the modern human brain organoids are spherical. Muotri says similar changes in neuronal development have been observed in the brains of children with autism, hinting they could be linked to socialization abilities. “If we believe that’s one of our advantages over Neanderthals,” he said, “it’s relevant.” "

FLORENCE, ITALY— Live Science reports that a team led by archaeologist Ursula Wierer of Italy’s Soprintendenza Archeologia has examined the tools carried by the frozen mummy known as Ötzi the Iceman with high-powered microscopes and computed tomography scans. The 45-year-old man died in the Italian Alps sometime between 3370 and 3100 B.C., most likely due to a head injury or an arrow thought to have pierced an artery in in his shoulder. He was carrying a dagger, an end scraper, a borer, a flake, an antler retoucher, and two arrowheads at the time of his death. Wierer said an opaque patina and lack of wear on the end scraper and the borer suggests they had been recently sharpened, which may be the source of the cut found on Ötzi’s right hand. The wear on the other tools suggests Ötzi was right handed, as does the development of the right side of his body. Wierer and her colleagues said many of the tools were made of chert that may have been obtained from outcroppings some 40 miles away from the area where Ötzi is thought to have lived. The researchers also noted that the arrowheads resembled those typically made by cultures living in northern Italy, while the end scraper resembled blade tools typically found at lake dwelling sites in Switzerland and southern Germany. “I think we have to imagine that the trade at the time was already quite far-reaching for certain raw materials and certain products,” Wierer said.

MANASSAS, VIRGINIA—According to an NPR report, a burial pit containing amputated human limbs has been discovered at Manassas National Battlefield Park. The bones in the “limb pit” were first spotted by a utility crew in 2014, and are thought to have been buried by field surgeons after the three-day Battle of Second Manassas, which is also known as the Second Battle of Bull Run. In all, two complete skeletons, 11 limbs, bullet fragments, and buttons from Union uniforms have been recovered from the pit. All of the limbs bear evidence of wounds and amputation cuts. Physical anthropologist Doug Owsley of the Smithsonian Institution explained that the striations left on the bones by the surgeons’ saws reveal their skills—the doctors started slowly to set the saw teeth, cut quickly through the bone, and then slowed again as they finished the cut to avoid further damage to the patient. National Park Service archaeologist Brandon Bies thinks the soldiers whose limbs ended up in the pit were wounded during a charge up a ridge called the Deep Cut, where thousands of Confederate soldiers were waiting to fire on them with rifles and muskets. Medical records and isotopic analysis of the bones may allow researchers to identify the soldiers and the surgeons who operated on them. "

Andreas Hennius of Uppsala University and his colleagues examined board-game pieces dating to the Late Iron Age in museum collections in Sweden, and found that most of them were made of whalebone dating to the mid-sixth century A.D. The large supply and standardized forms of the game pieces suggest the scale of production was beyond the whalebone supply available from the carcasses of beached whales. Analysis of the game pieces with ZooMS, or Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometer, showed they had all been made from the bones of the North Atlantic right whale, or Eubalaena glacialis , which swam slowly and close to shore, and floated after it was killed because it had so much blubber. In Norway, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of large boathouses and features for processing blubber that also date to the sixth century.

COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS— The Billings Gazette reports that continued analysis of the remains of the so-called Anzick-1 child and the more than 100 antler and stone tools found near his grave in Montana has shown that they all date to the Clovis period, between 13,000 and 12,700 years ago. Discovered on the Anzick family property in 1968 during construction work, the body and the tools had all been covered with red ochre. Previous study of the remains indicated the child died some 12,700 years ago, but questioned whether the tools had been buried at the same time. Some scholars thought the antler artifacts may have been handed down over generations, thus accounting for their older dates. The new tests, conducted from samples retrieved before the remains were reburied in 2014, isolated the amino acid hydroxyproline from the human bones and the antler artifacts, in order to conduct a test that would not be affected by contamination with modern carbon. This time, both the human remains and the antler artifacts were dated to between 12,725 and 12,900 years old. “It’s reassuring,” said molecular biologist Sarah Anzick, whose parents own the property where the child was found. “It’s a Clovis burial.” "

Sixty models are now available to the public online. More than 500 such regularly sized carved balls of stone have been found in northeast Scotland, the Orkney Islands, England, and Ireland. A single one has even turned up in Norway. Scholars have suggested the objects may have been used as parts of weapons, standardized weights for traders, rollers for moving megalithic monuments, or wound with twine or sinew and thrown. Some of the balls bear carved motifs that are also seen in carvings at Neolithic passage tombs. Anderson-Whymark said the similarities could indicate that people living in different regions interacted and shared common ideas. The new, detailed photographs of the carvings have revealed marks on some of the balls that had been hidden, and could offer new insight into their possible use. “We might be able to get a little bit more of that story out in the future by more detailed analysis of these things,” Anderson-Whymark said, “but they’re always going to be slightly enigmatic.” "

NARA PREFECTURE, JAPAN—According to a report in The Asahi Shimbun , traces of a large structure built during the first half of the eighth century A.D. have been found at the Miyataki archaeological site in central Japan, near the banks of the Yoshinogawa River. Archaeologists think it may be the main building of the Yoshino no Miya palace, mentioned in historic records and poetry as a place frequented by emperors, based upon its size and design. Scholars have been looking for the palace for years, and assumed it had been placed safely far away from the river, in the mountains, with views of the river. “I previously thought the poem depicts the palace in an exaggerated way,” said Makoto Ueno of Nara University, “but Yoshino no Miya was likely a detached palace to enjoy the beauty of the Yoshinogawa just as depicted in the poetry.” Michio Maezono of the Nara College of Arts added that the placement of this building could have facilitated religious services to honor the river god.

VANCOUVER, CANADA— The Vancouver Star reports that researchers led by Eric Guiry of the University of British Columbia have tracked the effect of deforestation and farming practices on the nitrogen cycle through the chemical analysis of Bronze Age animal bones from Ireland. The nitrogen cycle is the process of how the element circulates through the atmosphere, land, and oceans. The more than 700 bones in the study came from some 90 archaeological sites across Ireland. The test results suggest significant changes to the nitrogen composition of soil nutrients—and therefore the food chain—occurred when land use became more intensive through deforestation, agriculture, and grazing some 2,000 years ago. Guiry thinks small-scale agriculture up until that point was likely to have had little impact on nutrients in the environment. "

CARLISLE, PENNSYLVANIA—According to a New York Times report, geochemical analysis of Aztec and Mixtec turquoise artifacts conducted by geochemist Alyson Thibodeau of Dickinson College suggests the turquoise used in them had been mined in Mesoamerica, and not imported from the American Southwest, where ancient turquoise mines have been found. It had been previously thought that turquoise traveled south to Mesoamerica along a long-distance trade network before the arrival of the Spanish in the sixteenth century. “Not only do they have isotopic signatures that are absolutely consistent with the geology of Mesoamerica,” Thibodeau said, “but they are completely different from the isotopic signatures of the Southwestern turquoise deposits and artifacts that we have seen so far.” Thibodeau's colleague David Killick of the University of Arizona argues that the test results suggest there may have been no organized contact between Mesoamericans and people living in the American Southwest.

CHAO VALLEY, PERU—According to a Live Science report, three geoglyphs have been found at a ceremonial landscape called Pampa de las Salinas in northern Peru in addition to two that were discovered in the 1970s. Ana Cecilia Mauricio of Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru said the ceremonial site is thought to have been shared by nearby communities, but researchers are not sure how it was used. Mauricio explained that the five known circular geoglyphs were made with piles of small, angular rocks within larger quadrangular spaces measuring at least 164 feet wide by 164 feet long. The geoglyphs may have been intended to depict astronomical constellations—one of them has been identified as the Southern Cross—“although we haven’t [made] this interpretation yet since we are still recording them,” Mauricio said. Thermoluminescence dating could help date the structures. The oldest area of the Pampa de las Salinas was built about 6,000 years ago, and the site ceased to be used about 3,000 years ago. "

WEST HIGHLANDS, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that a team of researchers from the National Trust for Scotland are surveying the well-preserved site of the Battle of Glen Shiel, the only conflict of the 1719 Jacobite uprising. On the day of the battle some 1,150 Highlanders were joined by soldiers sent by Spain, which was also at war with Britain at the time. The Spanish government had sent around 5,000 troops to Scotland, but a storm off England’s south coast prevented all but 300 from reaching the West Highlands. Archaeologist Derek Alexander said he and his colleagues are using documents created by British Army soldier John-Henri Bastide to guide their investigation. “Apart from some forestry, the landscape has really remained unchanged,” he said. “There have been changes to the road layout but you can still see pretty much the whole battlefield.” Alexander added that the battle was also noted as the first time the British Army used small, portable weapons known as coehorn mortars, which lobbed explosives high into the air, and made it possible to hit the hillside positions taken by the Jacobites and the Spanish. “After 1719, a recommendation was made that the government garrison forts should be equipped with a number of these guns,” he said.

She suspects there were probably more settlements, but they have been lost over the years. “It is likely the [River] Clyde was an important artery, connecting different areas to the sea and to the islands,” she said. “People would have traveled by water instead of through the wooded interior of the country and people were generally concentrated in the coastal regions.” Discovered in the late nineteenth century, the Cochno Stone, a Neolithic cup and ring rock art panel, is one of the 30 markers in West Dunbartonshire. Another 36 carvings in Inverclyde to the north have also been recorded. The next step is to plot the rock art sites on a map of other Neolithic remains. Barnett said the project could help scholars understand how rock art was used, and if it may have marked meeting points for trade and the sharing of news. "

The city is thought to be Bassania, which was described by the Roman historian Livy in his discussion of battles with Gentius, the last king of Illyria. Piotr Dyczek of the University of Warsaw said the city’s gate, two bastions, and wide stone walls have been uncovered. The ten-foot wide walls were constructed of stone blocks and filled with small stones and earth. Coins and pottery found near the walls have been dated to as early as the fourth century B.C. Dyczek thinks the city was forgotten after the defeat at the hands of the Romans, since it is not known to have been mentioned in the writings of later travelers.

CORAL GABLES, FLORIDA—Neurologist David Kushner of the University of Miami and bioarchaeologist John Verano of Tulane University conducted a study of skulls from throughout Peru bearing evidence of trepanation, and found that during various periods as many as 80 percent of the pre-Columbian patients survived the procedure, according to a report in Science Magazine . The earliest skulls in the study to show signs of trepanation—the act of drilling, cutting, or scraping a hole in a skull for medical reasons—dated back to 400 B.C., and came from Peru’s southern coast. The latest skulls in the study, from the Inca Empire, dated to the sixteenth century A.D. If the surgical hole showed no signs of healing, the researchers concluded that the patient had died either during surgery or shortly thereafter. Smooth bone around the opening was taken to indicate the patient survived long enough for the bone to heal. The study suggests that about 40 percent of the earliest patients survived, but by the Inca period, between 75 and 83 percent of the patients recovered. Kushner also noted that the trepanation technique appears to have improved over time—the holes became smaller with less cutting and drilling of bone, and thus less risk of brain injury. "

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6672-180607-male-gene-bottleneck,Neolithic,"Did Most Men Die Off 7,000 Years Ago?. STANFORD, CALIFORNIA— Live Science reports that population geneticist Marcus Feldman of Stanford University has proposed a new explanation for the population bottleneck between 5,000 to 7,000 years ago detected in the genes of modern men, which suggest that during this stretch, there was just one male for every 17 females. Feldman and his team conducted 18 simulations that took into account factors such as Y chromosome mutations, competition between groups, and death. The study suggests that warfare among people living in clans made up of males from the same line of descent could have wiped out entire male lineages and decreased the diversity of the Y chromosome. In this scenario, there are not dramatically fewer males, but there was significantly less diversity in their genes. “In that same group, the women could have come from anywhere,” Feldman said. The study found no bottleneck in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child. “[The women] would’ve been brought into the group from either the victories that they had over other groups, or they could’ve been females who were residing in that area before,” he said, since the victorious male warriors may have killed all the men they conquered, but kept the women alive and assimilated them.

Measuring about 50 feet long, the ship is thought to have been used to carry goods across Lake Ontario. Team leader Carolyn Kennedy said the ship had been patched and modified, but it is not yet clear why. Kennedy's investigation should offer insight into how the sailors lived and what cargo they had on board. “They would have carried all that cargo to the settlers who were coming to the city of York, to the city of Toronto, who would really have needed a lot of supplies because there would have been a lot of wilderness out here,” she said.

The poorly preserved bones, which were discovered near Venice in 2007, belonged to a man of slim stature and below average height who had been buried directly into the ground, rather than placed in a tomb with grave goods. “We found a particular lesion on the right calcaneus [heel bone] passing through the entire bone,” said medical anthropologist Emanuela Gualdi of the University of Ferrara. No evidence that his wrists had been nailed to a cross has been found, but Gualdi said they could have been tied to the cross with rope. She notes that crucifixion was commonly used to execute slaves and criminals in Roman society. “We cannot know if he was a prisoner,” she said, “but the burial marginalization indicates that he probably was an individual deemed dangerous or defamed in Roman society.” "

JAMESTOWN, VIRGINIA— The Williamsburg Yorktown Daily reports that a cellar has been found under the current church building at James Fort. The building now standing at the site was constructed in 1906, but historic records indicate the first brick church was constructed in 1617. “This [cellar] we assume has to be pretty darn early because it’s already been abandoned and backfilled prior to 1617,” said archaeologist Danny Schmidt of Jamestown Rediscovery. He thinks a different type of building stood on the site, located outside the fort’s original walls, between 1608, when the fort was expanded, and 1617. The fill in the cellar contained the colony’s trash items, such as scrap copper, a dagger hilt, oyster shells, gun parts, eggshells, glass beads, pipe fragments, and a Harington Farthing—a small copper coin. Archaeologists note that the cellar fill had been disturbed by the burials of the dead under the church floor, and by the construction of the current church.

Sunna Ebenesersdóttir of the University of Iceland suggests the population rapidly shifted from a roughly even mix of Norse and Gaelic ancestry some 1,000 years ago, to mostly Norse ancestry today. The team analyzed genomes obtained from 27 ancient skeletons found across Iceland, and found that these early settlers of the island had genes associated with populations from Norway, Sweden, Ireland, and Scotland. The researchers then used a computer simulation to model the change to predominantly Norse ancestry, and found evidence for genetic drift, or random fluctuations in gene frequencies, which has been seen in isolated populations of animals. The study notes that recent immigration from Scandinavia, and especially from Denmark, also had an impact on Iceland’s gene pool. The scientists note that those settlers with Gaelic ancestry were likely to have been enslaved, giving those with Norse ancestry a reproductive advantage. In addition, the enslaved may have been buried in unmarked graves, possibly leaving them underrepresented in the test sample. "

BUFFALO, NEW YORK—A new survey of southeastern Alaska conducted by geologist Alia Lesnek of the University at Buffalo suggests a boat route headed southward into the New World would have been mostly free of ice some 17,000 years ago, according to a report in Science Magazine . To determine how long rocks from four islands along the southeastern coast of Alaska had been exposed to air, Lesnek measured the concentration of beryllium-10 in the rocks. Since cosmic rays change individual oxygen-16 atoms in quartz to beryllium-10 atoms, higher levels of beryllium-10 translate to longer exposure. The study also indicates that the early migrants from Beringia would have found plenty of plant and animal life along the Pacific coastline. Lesnek and her colleagues reexamined animal bones recovered from caves, and adjusted their radiocarbon dates for the effects of marine diets. The results suggest that the oldest bones had been left behind by carnivores some 45,000 years ago. The researchers also found a lack of bones dating to between 20,000 and 17,000 years ago, which could suggest the area had been covered in ice in the years before the Beringians took to the sea. "

Ötzi is the name given to the man whose naturally mummified, 5,300-year-old remains were discovered frozen in the Alps by hikers in 1991. Previous studies have determined that Ötzi may have suffered from bad teeth and knees, propensity to ulcers, and perhaps even Lyme disease, before he likely died around the age of 46 from a blow to the head and an arrow wound in his shoulder. The new study has revealed three calcifications in the region of his heart. Scientists say these hardened plaques put him at an increased risk of a heart attack. He also had calcifications around his carotid artery, and in the arteries at the base of his skull, which could have increased his risk of stroke. An earlier study had found that Ötzi carried a genetic predisposition for atherosclerosis, or a narrowing of the arteries from fatty deposits. Patrizia Pernter, a radiologist at the Central Hospital in Bozen-Bolzano and a member of the research team, said this was probably the most important factor in Ötzi’s heart disease, since he was fit and didn’t smoke tobacco.

Temples dedicated to Anubis and Sobek have also been located in the region. Many of the hieroglyphs, which were engraved into the rock, or engraved and then painted, are prayers that were written by scribes and, in some cases, signed. “We know Egyptian beliefs primarily from official texts from monumental temples and tombs, made for royals and elite members,” Ejsmond explained. These inscriptions, however, offer a glimpse into the popular religious beliefs of priests and pilgrims. The inscriptions have been difficult to see and study because the shape of the hill where they are located has changed over the years, putting the faded texts out of easy reach. "

ARROCHAR, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that a team led by Heather James of Calluna Archaeology found more than 80 archaeological sites dating to the seventeenth century during a survey of the western shores of Loch Lomond, which is located in west-central Scotland. The sites include farmsteads, bridges, sheepfolds, earthen banks, quarries, cairns, and almshouses for travelers. The territory has long been associated with Clan MacFarlane, whose castle was located on the loch’s island of Elanvow. A possible watchtower site, discovered on Tarbet Island, may have been used by the MacFarlanes to monitor the area. “They were a clan who struggled to keep their head above water, but they eventually made peace with their rivals, the Campbells, which helped them for a while,” James said. The lands were eventually sold in the eighteenth century to pay off debts at a time when many of the clan’s men moved to other parts of Scotland, Ireland, or America. The land is now part of a national park. "

AARHUS, DENMARK— AFP reports that the 2,000-year-old bones of more than 80 boys and men have been recovered from a bog in Denmark that could hold the remains of as many as 380 people. Mette Løvschal of Aarhus University said many of the well-preserved bones bear fresh cut marks from sharp weapons. She thinks the boys and men were killed in battle by Roman soldiers who raided Germania, or by warriors from a rival tribe. “They do not seem to have a lot of healed trauma, from experience with previous battles,” she said. Most of the wounds are on the right sides of the warriors’ bodies, which suggests they had been holding shields with their left arms. Gnaw marks on the bones suggest the bodies lay on the battlefield before they were stripped of personal belongings and deposited in the bog. Four of the pelvises found in the bog had been strung on a stick. “It seems to have aggressive undertones to it as well,” Løvschal said. "

MEAUX, FRANCE—Philippe Charlier of Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and his colleagues examined teeth and skull fragments held in Moscow and identified as Adolf Hitler’s for evidence of the manner of his death in Berlin in 1945, according to an AFP report. Analysis of the tartar deposits on the teeth found no evidence of meat consumption. Charlier said this agreed with Hitler’s known vegetarianism. The researchers also said the skull fragments were consistent with radiographies taken of Hitler’s skull a year before his death. A hole thought to have been made by a bullet was found in one of the skull fragments. The teeth showed no evidence of powder from a gunshot, so the bullet is thought to have entered through the neck or the forehead. Charlier added that bluish deposits on the false teeth may have been caused by a chemical reaction between cyanide and metal. “We didn’t know if he had used an ampule of cyanide to kill himself or whether it was a bullet in the head,” Charlier said. “It’s in all probability both.” "

QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA—A computer simulation suggests that Australia was settled by purposeful migrants between 50,000 and 65,000 years ago, and not accidental travelers, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. Sean Ulm of James Cook University and his colleagues simulated likely routes from the islands of Timor and Roti to islands off Australia’s northwest coast that are now submerged, in a computer model that included information from deep-sea mapping and wind and ocean currents, and accounted for paddling. The modelling suggests that accidental drifting would not have led to landings on Australia’s northwestern islands. Ulm estimates it would have taken well-prepared voyagers between four and seven days to complete the 90-mile trip. “It has to be purposeful, it has to be coordinated and it has to be fairy large-scale to explain the patterns we see,” Ulm said. Genetic studies have suggested the population that made the original voyage numbered between 100 and 200 individuals. "

AIRTH, SCOTLAND— The Falkirk Herald reports that archaeologists led by historian John Reid are investigating a possible site for the sixteenth-century royal dockyards near Clackmannanshire Bridge, which spans the Firth of Forth. So far the team of researchers has found the foundations of mill buildings next to the channel, a millstone that had been reused as a paver, a corn-drying kiln, a well-built stone sea wall, and posts from a wooden pier. Ships known to have been serviced at the royal dockyards include the Great Michael , flagship of King James IV, and the Margaret , the second ship of the Navy, which was named for the queen, Margaret Tudor. Both ships are thought to have been at the docks in 1513 before sailing to the Battle of Flodden, where James IV was killed. “Although it’s impossible to say for now whether this dates to the right period for James’ docks, we’ve submitted samples of the wood for radiocarbon dating,” said archaeologist Elinor Graham of the University of St. Andrew’s. “We also had a coin from the stone pier, which will need to be looked at by experts, but which might give us a date for its construction, too.” "

EXETER, ENGLAND— The Independent reports that South America’s forests of Araucaria, or monkey puzzle trees, naturally grow on south-facing slopes, but are found everywhere in areas where archaeological sites are found. Mark Robinson of the University of Exeter and his colleagues measured levels of different forms of carbon in soil samples, concluding that many of today’s forests could have been planted by Southern Jê communities for their timber, fuel, food, and resin. The study indicates that the number of trees expanded between 4,480 and 3,200 years ago, when the region covered by Chile, Brazil, and Argentina experienced an increase in moisture, and again some 800 years ago, when conditions were drier, but when the population of the Southern Jê grew as well. Robinson thinks the communities may have modified the soil of the grasslands where they lived, protected seedlings, or even planted trees to establish the forests in places where they otherwise would not have flourished. He added that five of the 19 species of monkey puzzle trees are currently endangered by the practice of logging and encroaching farmland. "

Unlike the nearby city of Herculaneum, which lies closer to Mt. Vesuvius and was buried under more than 65 feet of ash from the ground up, Pompeii was covered in about 13 feet of falling ash, which preserved fewer of the city’s second stories.

VANCOUVER, CANADA—An inscribed piece of limestone is thought to be the earliest example of our alphabet sequence, according to a Live Science report. Thomas Schneider of the University of British Columbia said three of the words in the 3,400-year-old inscription start with the equivalents of the letters B, C, and D. At the time, he noted, the letter “g” was used to produce the sound we now represent with the letter “c.” So in this case, “B” is for “bibiya-ta,” or “earth snail;” “C” is for “garu,” or “dove;” and “D” is for “da’at,” or kite. Symbols in front of the letters may mean “gecko,” or “lizard,” suggesting the whole phrase read, “and the lizard and the snail, and the dove and the kite.” The stone was discovered in the tomb of an Egyptian foreign affairs official named Sennefer, and although the text was written in hieratic, a form of Egyptian hieroglyphic writing, Schneider said the words themselves were Semitic in origin. He thinks the artifact may have been used as a mnemonic device to help Sennefer remember the order of the letters in Eastern Mediterranean languages. Another alphabetic sequence that has since fallen out of use was found on the opposite side of the piece of limestone. "

RENO, NEVADA—According to a Science Magazine report, evidence of Roman-era air pollution trapped in Greenland’s ice cap has been analyzed in detail by an international team of researchers led by Andrew Wilson of the University of Oxford and Joe McConnell of the Desert Research Institute. The experts examined layers of ice measuring some 1,300 feet deep, and obtained about 12 measurements of lead levels trapped in the ice for each year from 1100 B.C. to A.D. 800. The resulting 1,900-year timeline offers a detailed picture of pollution related to smelting silver, dust, and volcanic emissions. The study suggests that Roman lead pollution peaked in the first century A.D., during the height of the Empire when many silver coins were minted, and dropped dramatically around the year 165, likely due to the devastation brought by the Antonine Plague. A third-century drop has been attributed to the political instability brought on by the so-called Plague of Cyprian. The scientists also recorded dips in the level of lead pollution during times of war in Spain, where a lot of lead-silver smelting took place. "

Anna Kubicka of Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, and Konrad Grochecki of Maria Curie-Sklodowska University, collected data and created a map of the site using measurements made with airborne laser scanning equipment. The map revealed outlines of two lines of ramparts, one on the lower part of the hill, and one on the surface of the steeper, higher part, where the pyramid-shaped mausoleum had been built for Pawel Orzechowski, chamberlain of Chelm. At that time, the hill was referred to as a “horodysko,” or a place where a fort once stood. Other documents state that Orzechowski wanted to be buried in the mausoleum “together with his ancestors.” As an Arian, who rejected Christian Trinitarian doctrine, Orzechowski would not have been eligible for burial in a Catholic cemetery. Renovation of the mausoleum, which was damaged during World War II, and archaeological investigations of the possible fort are being planned. "

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA—According to a report in The Independent , a new study suggests that Homo naledi , a hominin that lived between 236,000 and 335,000 years ago, may have been highly intelligent. Its fossils, discovered in a cave in South Africa in 2015, exhibit a mix of primitive and advanced characteristics, including a small brain about the size of an orange, hands that may have been able to make tools, and small feet. In addition, the fossils were recovered from a hard-to-reach cave chamber, which suggests Homo naledi may have engaged in complex behaviors such as deliberate disposal of the dead. Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand and Ralph Holloway of Columbia University pieced together Homo naledi skull fragments and created a digital reconstruction of skull interiors, in order to learn more about the creatures’ brains. The scans showed complexity in areas of the Homo naledi brains linked to emotions in modern humans, and a large frontal lobe, an area associated with language. “Here we have a violation of that sacred cow—the idea there was this link between ever-increasing brain size paralleled with ever-increasing complexity,” Berger said.

The bases of the structure were discovered on either side of a Roman road measuring about 23 feet wide, near an inscription glorifying Roman Emperor Diocletian that dates to A.D. 303. So far, the excavation team, led by Elena Bozhinova of the Plovdiv Museum of Archaeology, and Kamen Stanev of the Cyril and Methodius Scientific Center, has uncovered one side of the structure to a depth of about six feet. “The building material is sandstone because at the time the Romans had not started to process the local syenite,” Bozhinova said. Large holes in the blocks held cramp irons covered in lead that held the stones together. Architectural fragments recovered earlier in the dig are now thought to be part of the arch’s upper elements. The arch is thought to have collapsed during an earthquake, and its large stone blocks reused in a building set in the middle of the Roman road.

Bartosz Kontny of the University of Warsaw said the fittings had been made in the shapes of male and female genitalia. “These amulets were believed to ensure happiness and protect against evil forces,” he said. One artifact, made of gold-plated copper, would have been worn on a hip belt. It depicts the spear of a beneficiarius, a high-ranking army officer, as a symbol of his power. Similar artifacts have been found in central Germany, where the Roman army is known to have been. Kontny thinks the soldiers may have been in Poland to protect the amber trade. “The Romans valued this material,” he said. The Romans may have also ventured into Poland from Germany while recruiting soldiers to assist the Vandals in their fight against the Suebi. “According to the records of the Roman historian Cassius Dion, the Emperor Domitian sent a hundred riders to help them,” Kontny said. “It is possible that some of the objects we discovered were parts of equipment of one of those riders.” "

An international team of researchers led by Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History sampled about 90 different skeletons bearing the telltale deformations of leprosy. The skeletons were unearthed in Europe, and have been dated to between A.D. 400 and 1400. From the bones, the scientists reconstructed ten new genomes of medieval Mycobacterium leprae , in addition to the one or two strains already known to have been circulating in medieval Europe. “This latest research shows all the strains of the leprosy bacterium were in fact present in medieval Europe, which strongly suggests leprosy originated much closer to home, possibly in the far southeast of Europe, or western Asia,” said Helen Donoghue of University College London. The oldest strain was detected in a skeleton found in Great Chesterford, Essex, in southeast England, which has been dated to between A.D. 415 and 545. This is the same strain found in modern-day red squirrels, and may have been introduced to Britain through the ancient squirrel fur trade.

LAWRENCE, KANSAS—According to a Live Science report, a new genetic study conducted by an international team of researchers suggests there were about 250 people in the first group to enter the New World from Siberia some 15,000 years ago. Nelson Fagundes of Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, Michael Crawford of the University of Kansas, and their colleagues analyzed DNA samples obtained from ten Native American individuals living in Central and South America, ten people from different Siberian groups, and 15 people from China. Computer simulation models helped the scientists work backward from the genetic variation and divergence seen in the populations today to figure out the original size of the so-called founding group. “Large populations have very efficient selection,” Fagundes explained, “while in small populations, mildly deleterious alleles can spread, which may increase genetic susceptibility to some diseases.” The estimate for the founding population in this case is so small that there would have been little genetic variation associated with the first wave of migration. Fagundes added that new genetic mutations, and the addition of later waves of migrants, eventually increased genetic diversity among Native American populations. "

They are confident it was a horse based on a clear imprint of the animals’ ear, which had been pressed into the ground. The horse is thought to have stood about five feet tall at the withers. Traces of a harness with iron and bronze fittings were found near its head, suggesting it may have been a parade horse. The skeletons of donkeys and mules have been recovered from a stable at the House of the Chaste Lovers, but Pompeii officials said this is the first complete outline of a horse to be found in the ruined city.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6606-180509-kenya-occupied-cave,Paleolithic,"Continuously Occupied Cave Excavated in East Africa. JENA, GERMANY— Haaretz reports that evidence for 78,000 years of human occupation has been found in Kenya’s Panga ya Saidi network of caves, ranging from the Middle Stone Age to the present day. The cave’s main chamber measures more than 1,000 feet square, and could have housed hundreds of people, according to Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, although it has recently been used just for burials and rituals. Stone arrowheads, blades, and tools with a dull edge for attachment to a shaft first appeared in the cave’s layers dated to about 67,000 years ago, or some 10,000 years after the first inhabitants, who used larger stone tools, moved in. Kenya’s oldest-known bead, dated to about 65,000 years old, was also recovered. Carved bones, tusks, and worked pieces of ochre were found in layers dated between 48,000 and 25,000 years ago. Petraglia explained that the turning points in technologies were marked by mixes of tools and artifacts, rather than sudden changes. He thinks the cave’s inland location, in a transitional area between the forest and the savannah, may have provided generations of residents with a stable environment at a time when other areas of Africa experienced drought.

CAIRO, EGYPT—According to a report in Ahram Online , a tomb dating to the reign of Ramesses II (1279–1213 B.C.) has been discovered in Saqqara. Ola El-Aguizy of Cairo University said that inscriptions on the tomb walls indicate it belonged to General Iwrkhy, his son Yuppa, and grandson Hatiay. Iwrkhy is thought to have moved to Egypt from another land when he began his career under Seti I, and to have attained his high rank in the court of Ramesses II. Images on the walls relate to Iwrkhy’s military career, including an infantry unit and charioteers crossing a waterway dotted with crocodiles, presumed to be Egypt’s eastern border, and relationships with other countries, such as pictures of Canaanite wine jars being unloaded from boats. Other images depict daily life in the military garrison. The tomb features a forecourt, a statue room, plastered vaulted storehouses, a peristyle court, and chapels. Excavation of the tomb will continue. "

MASURIA, POLAND— Science in Poland reports that a 14-year-old boy on vacation with his family discovered documents and family heirlooms once owned by an aristocratic Prussian family in two milk cans buried near Lake Jeziorak in northeastern Poland. Most of the objects, including glasses, toiletries, clothing, hunting accessories, military decorations, a Wehrmacht officer uniform, banknotes, jewelry, a pocket watch, and a silver spoon, had been owned by Count Hans Joachim von Finckenstein, who lived in an estate near the lake until 1945. The cans also contained his will, marked with the family seal and coat of arms, a diary dating to World War I, letters, postcards, notes, and family photo albums. The personal items were handed over to the count’s daughter, who is now 81 years old and lives in Germany. She and a sister had been sent away from the estate before the arrival of the Red Army in 1945. Although the count eventually died in a Soviet camp, his wife was reunited with the children in Germany. Researcher Michal Mlotek thinks she may have buried the items before she left. “You can guess that these were things that could be used again after being retrieved,” he said, “most of them had a sentimental value, so in a sense they were a family treasure.” "

WELSHPOOL, AUSTRALIA—According to a report in The Guardian , the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in the Indian Ocean has revealed two nineteenth-century ships, about 20 miles apart, some 1,400 miles off the southwest coast of Australia. Tests of samples of coal recovered from both wreck sites suggest the vessels had traveled from Britain. The first ship was found in splinters, in a debris field of coal, as if it sank after an explosion. A large, rectangular metal object at the site has been identified as a water tank. Records of coal ships lost during the nineteenth century are incomplete, but researchers suggest the wooden ship may be the brig W Gordon , which had been traveling to Australia from Scotland when it disappeared in 1877, or the barque Magdala , which was lost in 1882 while sailing from Wales to Indonesia. The second wreck, found sitting upright on the seabed, is thought to have been made of iron and to have had at least two decks. This ship may be the barque West Ridge , which sank in 1883. “These are the deepest wrecks so far located in the Indian Ocean, they’re some of the most remote shipwrecks in the world,” said Ross Anderson of the Western Australian Museum.

COLCHESTER, ENGLAND—According to a report in the Daily Gazette , scientists have detected a family relationship among individuals whose remains were found in a fourth-century A.D. burial site in southeast England. Earlier burials in the cemetery, which date to the era of Roman paganism, were laid out north-south, while later Christian burials, associated with traces of a church building, were oriented east-west. The configuration of the graves also suggested to researchers that the Christian cemetery had been arranged in family plots. Scientists led by Nelson Fernández of Essex University analyzed mitochondrial DNA and human leukocyte antigen from bone samples of 29 individuals in the Christian-era cemetery. “It means we have been able to for the first time scientifically prove the long-held theory there were family burial areas at the Butt Road Roman cemetery by showing they shared the same inherited genetic markers,” Fernández said.

PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC— Czech Radio reports that researchers from the City of Prague Museum excavated the city’s Wenceslas Square and St. Valentine’s Gate, where they found a wooden doorstep and traces of the city’s medieval ramparts. Analysis of the oak step suggests the tree used to make it had been cut down around the year A.D. 1239. In Wenceslas Square, the team, led by archaeologist Petr Starec, found evidence of the market where horses were traded and agricultural products and crafts were sold from the mid-fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries. Starec said the markets and the dwellings in the area produced a lot of waste, including the bones of cattle, sheep, and goats; pottery; and horseshoes, so the muck was periodically covered with layers of pebbles from the Vltava River. A two-inch-tall Christian statue depicting the Virgin Mary holding the child Jesus was also recovered from the layers of Wenceslas Square. Starec thinks this valuable item must have been accidentally dropped by a wealthy person. “There is a little metal device on her back,” he said, “so it was probably attached to some object, perhaps a home altar.” "

LUZON, PHILIPPINES— Science Magazine reports that a team of scientists led by Thomas Ingicco of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and M. Clyde Shago of the National Museum of the Philippines has found butchered rhino bones and stone tools at Kalinga, an archaeological site on the island of Luzon. The enamel of one of the animal’s teeth was dated to about 709,000 years old, which corresponds with the results of electronic spin resonance testing of the sediments above and below the fossils and artifacts. The discovery is said to push back the known date for ancestral human occupation of the Philippines by more than 600,000 years. Archaic human fossils have not been found at the site, however, so scientists are not sure who butchered the rhino, but Homo erectus is a likely candidate. Homo erectus is thought to have evolved in Africa nearly two million years ago, and Homo erectus fossils of the same age as the site in the Philippines have been found in China and Java. "

Ana Majkic of the University of Bordeaux and her colleagues say the edges of the flake, which was unearthed at the Kiik-Koba archaeological site in Crimea, show the marks were not made before the flake was struck from a larger stone, and they reject the possibility that the stone was manipulated in order to create powder, or as a way to record a count. They add that the flake is too small to have been used as a cutting or scraping tool, and may have been crafted for the purpose of carrying the engravings, which they say were deliberately started and ended, and made with two pointed tools.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6588-180502-bronze-age-saw,Bronze Age,"Archaeologist Experiments With Possible Bronze Age Saw. BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA— Science News reports that archaeologist Nicholas Blackwell of Indiana University built a pendulum saw to test stone-cutting techniques that may have been employed by Mycenaean builders, beginning about 3,300 years ago. Distinctive, curved cuts have been found in the hard stone conglomerate at Mycenaean palaces, and scholars have surmised that they were made with some kind of swinging blade, but no ancient blades or evidence for pendulum saws have been found to date. With the help of his father, George, who is a plumber, Blackwell constructed the eight-foot-tall pendulum and a frame that would allow it to swing, and tested it with four bronze blades of varying shapes, including a long, curved blade; a triangular blade with a rounded tip; a short, straight-edged saw; and a long, straight-edged saw with rounded corners. The surface of the limestone cut during the testing was lubricated with water and sand every two minutes. The experiment shows that the straight blade with rounded corners produced a cut resembling those found at Mycenaean sites. Blackwell said that after a deep enough cut was made, a worker could have chiseled and hammered off stone on one side of the incision. "

Such “melted” stones have been found at Dun Deardail, Tap O’Noth, and Ord Hill. Matt Ritchie of Forestry Enterprise Scotland said the tests had shown the vitrified stone was likely produced when tall timber superstructures, such as roofed rampart walls, caught fire and heated the stone citadel below it “like an oven.” Now the researchers want to know whether the fires were accidental, or were set as an act of war, or were perhaps even ceremonial, set to mark the death of a revered ruler. “We may never know,” Ritchie said.

JOHNS COUNTY, FLORIDA— First Coast News reports that environmental archaeologist Lee Newsom of Flagler College examined samples of a ship’s hull that washed ashore on northern Florida’s Atlantic coast in March. “I removed ultra-thin slivers of the wood and mounted them on microscope slides,” she said. “Each wood has a fingerprint when you examine the cell structure.” Newsom was surprised to learn the ship had been constructed of American beech, which grows in the eastern United States, since ships built in the mid-nineteenth century were usually made of oak. She also found that the wood had been cut in a variety of ways, probably to reduce waste. She thinks these two factors could indicate wood was in short supply. Newsom will continue to study the well-preserved sample, and may eventually be able to track down where the ship was built. “They were knowledgeable,” she said of the shipwrights. “The way the wood was split, the way the treenails are made. It doesn’t look like a novice learning how to craft.” "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/6582-180430-poland-early-lamps,Neolithic,"Poland's Neolithic Light Sources Studied. WARSAW, POLAND—Archaeologist Krzysztof Tunia of Poland’s Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology suggests new light sources developed along with agriculture, according to a report in Science in Poland . Bonfires and wood torches were the primary source of light up until about 7,000 years ago, Tunia said, until simple pottery lamps came into use alongside the development of pottery for storage and cooking. Early lamps consisted of a wick made of plant material submerged in a flammable substance held in a shallow vessel. Many such vessels dating to the late Mesolithic and early Neolithic periods have been found in northern Poland, near the Baltic Sea, where the fat of marine animals could have been used as fuel. This could explain why similar lamps are not found in southern Poland, Tunia explained. There, charcoal found at a Neolithic flint mine is thought to have been left behind from torches used for light. Charcoal lines on the walls of the mine may have been made by rubbing the tip of the torch on the wall to create a larger flame. Lights would also have been needed to light the inside of dwellings, Tunia said, because doors and windows were limited in order to provide shelter and keep in warmth. "

TRUJILLO, PERU— Live Science reports that the 550-year-old remains of around 140 children and 200 llamas have been discovered at the Chimú site of Huanchaquito-Las Llamas in northern Peru. John Verano of Tulane University said the children’s bones bear cut marks and some of them had damaged ribs. The injuries suggest that the healthy and well-nourished children had been sacrificed and that some of their hearts had been removed, although scientists do not know whether the children were alive when they were cut open. Bright red pigment made from cinnabar had been placed on the children’s faces, perhaps as part of the ritual. Some of the llamas had ropes around their necks, and footprints at the site indicate they may have tried to flee. There were no signs of struggle from the children, however. They were buried facing the sea, while the llamas were buried facing the Andes Mountains, but Verano and his colleagues are not sure why. “One possibility is that llamas originally came from the highlands,” he said, “and the Chimú had deities and art that focused on marine themes, like fish and sea birds, so they had the children face the sea.” All of the bodies were placed in a layer of mud that was perhaps produced by a catastrophic weather event such as El Niño.

Archaeologists led by Petya Georgieva of Sofia University said the site, made up of homes that had been destroyed, is about 7,000 years old. Excavation of the pottery workshop revealed a large kiln and chimney and more than 60 ceramic vessels, as well as tools and anthropomorphic figurines. Many of the pots had been decorated with designs applied with white and red paint. Georgieva thinks the vessels were made for trade, since there were so many of them, and the workshop was situated at a crossroads near settlements built on deposits of copper ore, rock salt, and gold.

TOKYO, JAPAN— Seeker reports that Naomichi Ogihara of Keio University, Takanori Kochiyama of the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, and Hiroki C. Tanabe of Nagoya University and their colleagues constructed 3-D models of Neanderthal and early Homo sapiens brains using a technique called computational neuroanatomy. The team members based the models on virtual casts of Neanderthal fossil skulls from Israel, France, and Gibraltar and early Homo sapiens from Israel and the Czech Republic; the skull of an early modern human who lived some 30,000 years ago; information collected from MRIs of more than 1,000 living humans; and non-human primate brains. The resulting models indicate that Neanderthal brains were larger than those of modern humans, but they had smaller cerebellums. This region of the brain is associated with language comprehension and production, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. “We are not saying that Neanderthals were incapable of processing languages,” Ogihara said. “We think they could communicate verbally, but their social ability using languages was probably limited because of the brain structural differences.” The scientists also suggest Neanderthals had a larger occipital lobe than early modern humans, perhaps to compensate for low light levels in Europe.

A carved scarab beetle and a piece of iron that may have been part of a bridle were also found in the horse’s grave. The metal is said to be the oldest piece of worked iron yet found in Africa. Bioarchaeologist Michelle Buzon of Purdue University said that examination of the animal’s bones, some of which still bore bits of chestnut fur with white markings, revealed it was a mare who died between the ages of 12 and 15. Stress on her ribs and spine indicate she wore a chariot harness during her active life. "

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA— Haaretz reports that a team led by Lucinda Backwell of the University of the Witwatersrand created bone projectiles modeled after one unearthed in Sibudu Cave, a rock shelter in South Africa, in order to test its possible use as an arrowhead. The 61,700-year-old bone point was found in a hearth, and shows some heat damage, in addition to marks from being shaped with stone tools. The replica points were made from the fresh bones of elands, and were secured to reed shafts with animal sinew. All of the marks on the bone points were scanned and recorded before testing began. The arrows were then shot from bows made of wood and kudu tendon into a goat carcass. One of the new points was also heated and dried in order to compare it with the damage seen on the ancient artifact. Analysis of the micro-cracks on the new bone arrowheads suggests the point found at Sibudu Cave was likely to have been shot with a bow by a hunter before it was lost or disposed of in a hearth—some 10,000 years earlier than bows are known to have been used in Eurasia.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6575-180426-footprints-sloth-hunt,Paleolithic,"Trackway May Record Prehistoric Hunters in Action. POOLE, ENGLAND— Science Magazine reports that human and giant ground sloth footprints estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000 years old have been found in New Mexico’s White Sands National Monument. Sedimentologist Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University said sloth trackways are usually straight or slightly curved, but when human prints are also found nearby, a sloth’s path sometimes turns sharply or indicates the animal reared up on its hind legs in order to use its front limbs and sharp claws for defense. Bennett and his colleagues suggest this trackway records a human pursuit of a sloth that weighed up to 2,000 pounds. In this scenario, the hunters extended their strides in order to step into the sloth’s footprints, until it reared up on its hind legs. This trackway also has “flailing circles,” which are left behind when an animal swivels around while attempting to protect itself from something in the environment. But critics question whether the humans who left these prints were actually hunting the sloth, suggesting that they may have instead found the fresh prints and decided to walk in them after the sloth had moved on.

YEKATERINBURG, RUSSIA— Science Magazine reports that the so-called Shigir Idol, a 16-foot-tall sculpture discovered in a peat bog near the border of Europe and Asia in the late nineteenth century, was carved from a single log some 11,600 years ago. Archaeologist Thomas Terberger of the University of Göttingen said the new dates, obtained from wood samples taken from the interior of the log, indicate that the monumental structure was carved by hunter-gatherers, and not members of a farming society, as had been previously thought. Archaeologist Mikhail Zhilin of the Russian Academy of Sciences and his excavation team recently explored Shigir and another bog site about 30 miles away. The researchers recovered small bone points, daggers, elk antlers carved with animal faces, wood-working tools, and a pine log that had been smoothed with an adze. “They knew how to work wood perfectly,” Zhilin said. He speculates that the Shigir Idol was created to depict spirits or demons thought to have lived in the new forests that were spreading across Eurasia at the close of the Ice Age. "

The pyroclastic flow eventually entered through the building’s windows and sealed the space. DNA analysis may reveal more information about the child. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/6568-180424-breastfeeding-genetic-mutation,Paleolithic,"New Thoughts on Shovel-Shaped Teeth. BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA—A genetic mutation linked to shovel-shaped incisors may have had a more consequential impact on breastfeeding, according to a report in Science Magazine . Researchers led by Leslea Hlusko of the University of California-Berkeley suggest a genetic mutation that became prevalent among the ancestors of Native Americans some 20,000 years ago may have helped them survive the dark, cold Arctic climate of Beringia by enhancing mothers’ milk ducts and increasing the amount of fat and vitamin D passed to infants. This gene is also linked to growth of thicker hair, increased development of sweat glands, and the shift to shovel-shaped incisors. The gene mutation is thought to have first occurred some 30,000 years ago in China, which had a hot, humid climate, leading researchers to speculate that the increased sweat glands offered a particular advantage. Hlusko says the shovel-shaped incisors seen in both East Asians and Native Americans were incidental to the benefits brought by natural selection through the sweat glands and improved infant nutrition. It had been previously thought that the shovel-shaped incisors themselves provided some sort of benefit to early Native Americans since their presence was widespread in known populations. "

The vessel, Australia’s first submarine, and its crew of 35 were lost in September 1914 while patrolling the area for German naval vessels. Rear Admiral Peter Briggs said the submarine’s stern cap, on the rear torpedo tube, had been fully opened. “It’s certainly a deliberate action from the crew,” he said. “It requires quite a few turns on a hand wheel to physically open it, it’s the first step in preparing a torpedo tube for firing.” The researchers suggest the crew may have been prepared for an encounter with a German ship when it ran into trouble on a dive and was crushed by water pressure, but they will continue to examine the high-definition video of the wreckage to try to determine what happened.

CAIRO, EGYPT— Ahram Online reports that excavations in Upper Egypt have uncovered a fragment of a sculpture of Marcus Aurelius and a shrine dedicated to Osiris. While working to reduce the level of water under the Kom Ombo temple in Aswan, archaeologists discovered the sculpture of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Aymen Ashmawi of the Ministry of Antiquities described the head as having wavy hair and a beard. The rare depiction of the emperor, who ruled from A.D. 161 to 180, will be cleaned and conserved. At the Karnak Temple in Luxor, archaeologists discovered the entrance, foundation, columns, inner walls, and floor paving stones to a shrine dedicated to Osiris-Ptah-Neb. It is thought to have been constructed during Egypt’s Late Period, between 664 and 332 B.C., and to have been expanded during later periods. Essam Nagy, head of the excavation, said pottery, statues, and a relief depicting a sheep and a goose and bearing the names of the kings Taharka and Tanut Amun, the last ruler of the 25th Dynasty, were also recovered.

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6562-180420-markings-symbols-ochre,Paleolithic,"When Did Humans First Use Symbols?. AARHUS, DENMARK—According to a report in Science Magazine , cognitive scientist Kristian Tylén of Aarhus University led a team of scientists who investigated the possibility that markings found on rocks at sites in South Africa could have been used as symbols by early humans. If the marks, which ranged in age from 52,000 to 109,000 years old, were made as decorations, Tylén reasoned, modern humans should be able to recognize the patterns, and if the marks had been reproduced as local cultural traditions to convey meaning, they should still be memorable. The scientists took 24 images found on stones and shells in Blombos Cave and another site in South Africa, cleaned them up, and showed them to 65 Danish university students, who were asked to distinguish between the marks and reproduce them after a brief glimpse. Tylén’s team found that the students were better able to remember and reproduce the more recent markings, but they were not able to distinguish them from each other, or sort them into groupings based upon where they had been found. Thus, Tylén thinks it is unlikely the markings were made as symbols with individual meanings. "

RAUNDS, ENGLAND—BBC News reports that a Neolithic monument known as Cotton Henge, which was discovered through the use of aerial photography in the 1970s, has been completely exposed for study in advance of a construction project in Northamptonshire. The henge’s outer ditch measures about 330 feet in diameter, and although the henge never contained any standing stones, it did have associated external banks. Researchers led by archaeologist Liz Mordue of Northamptonshire County Council discovered a possible entranceway to the enclosure on the southern side of the outer ditch. It may have been closed as a way of marking the end of its use. No entrance has been found in the inner ditch. The structure is thought to have been part of a Neolithic ceremonial landscape on the floodplain of the River Nene."

Angela Perri of Durham University said the three dogs had been buried individually, and that their bones did not bear any stone tool marks, which suggests they had died of natural causes. Examination of the animals’ lower jaws and teeth indicate that one of the dogs, from the Stilwell II site, and one of the dogs from the Koster site, resembled modern wolves. The second dog from Koster shared traits with today’s coyotes. The previously oldest-known dogs in North America lived some 9,300 years ago, before they were eaten by people living in what is now Texas. "

PARIS, FRANCE—Paleontologists Alain Froment and Fernando Ramirez Rozzi of the French National Center for Scientific Research suggest a hole in a cow skull uncovered at the Neolithic site of Champ-Durand in southwestern France could be evidence of a surgical procedure. According to a Gizmodo report, their analysis of the hole found no trace of fracturing or splintering, indicating it was not caused by goring from another cow, or a puncture from a powerful blow with a stone tool. The wound does, however, resemble holes found in human skulls attributed to the practice of trepanation. The hole in the cow skull shows no signs of healing, so either the animal did not survive the procedure, or it was already dead when the procedure was performed. Froment and Rozzi note that cows were common during the Neolithic period, so it was unlikely the surgeon needed to save the life of a food animal. They think the operation may have been practice for trepanation on humans. "

GLASGOW, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that traces of red and yellow pigments have been detected on the Antonine Wall’s distance stones with x-ray fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy technology. Built on a stone foundation in the second century A.D., the turf wall sat about 99 miles to the north of Hadrian’s Wall, and stretched about 37 miles from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Clyde. Louisa Campbell of Glasgow University said the bright colors on the engraved stones in the wall would have enhanced the impact of Roman propaganda on the local population. Red was used to paint images of Roman officers’ cloaks, and drops of blood on their captives. Ochre was used to give color to skin tones in the pictures. “The local population might not have been able to read the Latin inscriptions on the stone but they would certainly have been able to understand the sculptures and the context behind them,” Campbell said.  "

The extremely quiet Type XXI vessel was said to have been capable of travel from Europe to South America without surfacing. Historic records indicate the U-3523 had been carrying a crew of 58, but its mission is unknown. The submarine was found in the North Sea, about nine miles from the site where the British navy reported the hit, partially buried in the sea bed on a diagonal.

Zellmann-Rohrer said the “magical papyrus” describes the biblical story of the binding of Isaac, in which God told Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac on Mount Moriah. As the story is told in the biblical book of Genesis, God stopped Abraham from completing the sacrifice, but Zellmann-Rohrer said that in this text, written in Coptic, an Egyptian language that uses the Greek alphabet, the sacrifice was completed. Other known texts from antiquity relate the story in this way, Zellmann-Rohrer said. He also explained that the story had been copied onto the papyrus by multiple writers who were not likely to have been professional scribes."

The urn stands about 12 inches tall, and may contain cremains. “It’s almost a miracle that a plow has never hit it,” said archaeologist Catherine Frieman of Australian National University. Frieman’s team discovered the burial mound during a geophysical survey of farmland in the coastal area, which she suggests was important for the trade of metals such as Cornish tin during the Bronze Age. The surface of the mound is dotted with several features that look like pits, and is surrounded by a circular ditch with a single entrance. It had been previously thought that barrows in Cornwall had been constructed without ditches. "

The pair found a piece of silver and alerted the regional archaeology service, who investigated an area covering 4,300 square feet, and recovered braided necklaces, pearls, brooches, a Thor’s hammer, rings, and as many as 600 coins. More than 100 of the coins date to the reign of Harald Bluetooth, while the oldest in the cache dates to A.D. 714. “This trove is the biggest single discovery of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of great significance,” said archaeologist Michael Schirren. The treasure is thought to have been buried in the late 980s, when Bluetooth fled to Pomerania in the wake of a rebellion led by his son. "

Fourteen of the 30 accounts claimed that Custer’s men killed themselves with their revolvers in order to avoid death at the hand of the Native American warriors who had defeated them on June 26, 1876. But the data on 31 soldiers’ skeletal injuries suggests that only three of them committed suicide by shooting themselves in the head. Twenty-two of the men had skeletal damage consistent with dismemberment, scalping, or other wounds. “No doubt suicides happened among Custer’s men, but perhaps not on the grand scale previously suggested,” Mielke said. A larger study of the remains of the 268 soldiers of the 7th Cavalry who died during the battle would be required to get an estimate of how many of them actually committed suicide, she explained. "

ROME, ITALY— Science Alert reports that the remains of a man whose partially amputated right arm appears to have been replaced with a knife has been found in a Lombard necropolis in northern Italy. Archaeologist Ileana Micarelli of Sapienza University said the man died between the ages of 40 and 50 sometime during the sixth to eighth centuries A.D. He had been placed in the grave with his right arm bent at the elbow and laid across his torso. A knife blade, a D-shaped buckle, and decomposed organic material—probably leather—were found aligned with the arm. Micarelli said the man’s hand may have been amputated after an injury from a fall or combat. He survived, and the ends of the arm bones had formed a callus and a bone spur on the ulna, perhaps from wearing a prosthesis. Micarelli also noted that the teeth on the man’s right side were very worn, possibly from using them to tighten straps that held a prosthesis in place. A ridge of bone on his shoulder may have also been caused by frequent tightening movements. "

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a report in The Guardian , the lead coffins of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his family have been found in the cellar of St. Michael’s Church, which was built in 1831 on London’s Highgate Hill. When Coleridge died in 1834, he was buried in the chapel at the nearby Highgate School. But in 1961, the coffins were moved from the chapel’s crumbling vault to St. Michael's. There, they were stored in an area that had been the wine cellar of a mansion that previously stood on the site. The door to the cellar was bricked up. Since then, the exact location of the coffins had been forgotten and they languished amid the rubble from the demolished mansion that still litters the cellar. A recent investigation of the cellar, however, found the entrance to the wine vault, and the coffins were spotted through a ventilation gap in the bricks. It turned out the coffins were situated just under an inscription on a memorial slab in the nave of the church reading, “Beneath this stone lies the body of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.” “So that was a bit of a clue really,” said Drew Clode, a member of the parish.

YORK, ENGLAND—According to a report in Vox , evolutionary anthropologist Penny Spikins and anatomist Paul O’Higgins of the University of York and their colleagues think modern humans may have evolved smooth, long foreheads with agile eyebrows as a way to communicate emotions, and thus, enhanced the ability to survive. The researchers created a 3-D computer model of Kabwe I, a Homo heidelbergensis skull, and manipulated it to see whether shaving back its heavy brow ridge affected simulations of chewing meat, or how the brain case and eye sockets fit together. The analysis suggests that reducing the creature’s thick brow ridge would not have caused any functional problems. Spikins and O’Higgins speculate that the brow ridge may have instead served as a social signal of strength and dominance. Larger foreheads and smaller brow bones may have evolved along with more complex muscles for controlling subtle eye and eyebrow movements capable of expressing the modern human state of mind. "

LUND, SWEDEN— Science Nordic reports that scientists from Lund University analyzed the isotope levels in 82 sets of Stone Age skeletal remains found in Sweden and Denmark, and fish and animal bones uncovered at four Stone Age sites in Sweden spanning a period of about 3,000 years. The study suggests that people in the region heavily relied on fish, which made up just over half of their protein intake, and that they ate locally sourced foods. Those who lived by lakes and rivers ate carp, perch, and pike regularly, while those who lived by the sea ate mostly cod, but also herring, pollock, haddock, and dogfish. Adam Boethius of Lund University said the prevalence of fish in the Stone Age diet could indicate that people living in Scandinavia were not as mobile as previously believed. Seal meat made up 10 percent of the diet, and land animals, such as wild boar and red deer made up about 37 percent, while plants, mushrooms, berries, and nuts accounted for only about three percent of the foods eaten by Stone Age Scandinavians at one settlement. The prevalence of fish in the diet may have been underestimated in the past because the delicate bones are difficult to detect at archaeological sites. "

OXFORD, ENGLAND—A finger bone unearthed at the Al Wusta site in Saudi Arabia suggests that modern humans migrated out of Africa and into a widespread area as early as 85,000 years ago, according to a BBC News report. Huw Groucutt of the University of Oxford and his colleagues identified the bone by comparing a 3-D model of it to the finger bones of other modern humans and Neanderthals, whose finger bones are usually shorter and squatter. The age of the bone was determined with a technique called uranium series dating, which measures the ratio between radioactive elements in bone. The fossils of other African animals found at the site, such as those of hippos, wild cattle, and antelope, also dated to the same time period, suggesting that at the time it had a far more inviting and hospitable climate than it does today. But genetic studies have indicated that today’s living non-Africans are descended from people who dispersed from Africa some 60,000 years ago. Groucutt said the earlier human populations may have gone extinct, or may have been replaced by later waves of migrants. “The interesting thing,” Groucutt said, “is that in the past some people have said we couldn’t really spread into Asia until we had complex tools. [Our findings] suggest that that kind of migration didn’t really reflect a technological breakthrough, but reflects climate change.” "

BUDAPEST, HUNGARY— Science Magazine reports that Gábor Horváth and Dénes Száz of Eötvös Loránd University created computer simulations of 3,600 Viking sea voyages from Bergen, Norway, westward to Hvarf, Greenland, in order to test the possible use of sunstones in navigation. Scholars speculate the Vikings may have used ultrapure crystals of calcite, cordierite, and tourmaline to split sunlight and spot the rings of polarized light around the sun. This would make navigation possible on a cloudy day, when the sun is otherwise hidden. Sunstones are mentioned in Viking literature, but no such crystal has been found at any Viking shipwreck site. The simulation tested travel between the spring equinox and the summer solstice, and varied in the amount of cloud coverage, the type of crystal, and how often a navigator might have used a sunstone to find the sun and adjust the ship’s course. The simulations suggest that if the Vikings had checked the position of the sun every three hours or less, in an equal number of morning and afternoon readings, they could have successfully navigated to their destinations more than 90 percent of the time. Slight differences were found in the performance of the different minerals as well. Cordierite was found to be the most reliable overall. "

LONDON, ENGLAND—Neanderthal facial structure may have been an adaptation to an energetic lifestyle in cold climates, according to a report in The Guardian . A new study led by Stephen Wroe of Australia’s University of New England and Chris Stringer of London’s Natural History Museum suggests Neanderthal nasal passages, which were about 29 percent larger than those of modern humans, could warm and moisten large volumes of air. Using virtual reconstructions from CT scans, the researchers compared the skulls of Homo sapiens , Neanderthals, and Homo heidelbergensis . And while modern human nasal passages were found to be the most efficient at warming and humidifying air breathed in through the nose, Neanderthals would probably have been able to move air at a greater rate. “The calorific demands of Neanderthals were huge compared with ours,” Stringer said. “They were moving around a lot, they probably had less efficient clothing and therefore they are having to burn a lot more of their body fat to keep warm.” The study also suggests that Neanderthals did not appear to have a more powerful bite than modern humans, which had been suggested as a possible explanation for their facial structure.

The front of the temple, parts of its foundations, and its main entrance have been revealed, according to Aymen Ashmawi, head of the Ministry’s Ancient Egyptian Antiquities Department. The structure’s outer walls measure more than three feet thick. Chambers in the temple open to a courtyard. Upper lintels and corner pillars decorated with egg-and-dart designs and other motifs have been recovered along with pottery, coins, a sculpture of a man’s head, and two limestone lion statues, one of which is missing its head. Ashmawi said the excavation of the temple is expected to be completed this year. "

NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK— Science News reports that a new study suggests Ardipithecus ramidus , which lived some 4.4 million years ago and has been nicknamed “Ardi,” was able to both walk upright like a human and climb trees like an ape. Biological anthropologists Elaine Kozma and Herman Pontzer of the City University of New York, and an international team of researchers, collected data from the measurements of an 18-million-year-old pelvis from Ekembo nyanzae , an African ape; an Ardipithecus ramidus pelvis; and the pelvises of Lucy, a 3.2-million-year-old Australopithecus afarensis individual; and a 2.5 million-year-old Australopithecus africanus . The scientists then compared the measurements to data collected from the pelvises of modern humans, chimpanzees, and monkeys. In this way, the scientists were able to evaluate the relationship between the shape and orientation of the creatures’ lower pelvises and their ability to walk and climb. “Ardi evolved a solution to an upright stance, with powerful hips for climbing that could fully extend while walking, that we don’t see in apes or humans today,” Pontzer explained. The study also suggests that Australopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus africanus would have been able to walk upright, but had lost the ape-like climbing power possessed by Ardi . An earlier study of Ardi’s lower back also suggests it was flexible enough to support upright, straight-legged walking. "

BASEL, SWITZERLAND—According to a report in The Local , a team of researchers led by Peter-Andrew Schwarz of the University of Basel is experimenting with a stone-lined shaft discovered dug into the ground at the Roman site of Augusta Raurica, which is located on the Rhine River in northern Switzerland. Schwarz and his team are trying to determine whether the shaft may have been used by the Romans for cold storage during the summer months, since they are known to have used similar structures at other sites to chill cheese, wine, oysters, and other foods. For their first attempt, the scientists filled the shaft with snow all at once, but found that temperatures within the shaft rose above the freezing point even during the winter months. When Schwarz and his team instead gradually filled the shaft with snow and ice blocks, the snow lasted until June. For their current attempt at keeping the shaft cool, the researchers have borrowed the method employed by ice-makers on the island of Majorca—they will pack layers of snow about one foot deep into the shaft and separate them with layers of straw. The scientists will monitor temperatures in the shaft over the coming summer. "

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS— The New York Times reports that a mummified head discovered on top of a coffin in an Egyptian tomb in 1915 has been identified through DNA analysis. The tomb, located in the necropolis of Deir el-Bersha, belonged to Djehutynakht, a Middle Kingdom governor, but it was ransacked, robbed, and set on fire in antiquity. Scholars have been unsure whether the head, now housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, belonged to the governor or his wife. A CT scan of the head in 2005 revealed it was missing its cheek bones and part of its jaw hinge, which may have been able to help scientists determine whether the skull had belonged to a man or a woman. But a new genetic study of material from one of its molars has solved the mystery. “I honestly didn’t expect it to work because at the time there was this belief that it was not possible to get DNA from ancient Egyptian remains,” said Odile Loreille, an F.B.I. forensic scientist. Heavy damage to the DNA she extracted from the tooth confirmed it was ancient. Analysis of the material suggests the owner of the tooth was male, and, therefore, that it was Djehutynakht himself. "

CALLAGHAN, AUSTRALIA—According to a BBC News report, a new study has traced all of Australia’s indigenous languages back to a single, common language known as Proto-Australian, spoken some 10,000 years ago. Mark Harvey of the University of Newcastle and Robert Mailhammer of Western Sydney University say the languages spread from a small area in northern Australia, where the greatest diversity in language is found. Harvey, Mailhammer, and their colleagues searched for recurrent and systematic traits in the sounds of words among the 120 surviving indigenous languages, and found them in the basic vocabularies spoken by people who lived as much as 60 miles apart. It “makes it very unlikely that they are the results of chance or [subsequent] language contact,” Mailhammer said. But the study results are not a good fit with the current understanding of how the first Australians spread across the continent. “So there are still lots of questions about how we understand the prehistory of Australia,” said Harvey.

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA— Live Science reports that restoration and conservation of the tomb of Tutankhamun is nearly complete. When discovered by Howard Carter in 1922, the tomb in the Valley of the Kings had been sealed for more than 3,000 years by mud and rocks due to flooding that occurred soon after Tutankhamun’s death. Members of the Getty Conservation Institute and Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry analyzed brown spots that appeared on the walls soon after Carter opened the tomb. The spots were found to have been caused by microbes that are now dead and therefore no longer a threat to the ancient artworks. The wall paintings have been stabilized, and a new ventilation system was added to the tomb to deal with the humidity and carbon dioxide produced by visitors. Tourists can also bring dirt and dust into the tomb, which can lead to paint loss. New barriers have been installed to try to prevent additional scratches from being made on the walls in the tight space. Project specialist Lori Wong explained that the project has also allowed the conservators to collect information about the condition and causes of deterioration of the tomb that will help conservators to protect it in the future.

Infrared photographs revealed a human image on the piece of wood, which dates to sometime between the late seventh and the late tenth centuries. The picture suggests the object was used as a “hitogata,” or scapegoat doll. Such dolls were used in purification ceremonies, known as o-harae, and other Shinto rituals. “It is possible to hypothesize that extraordinary o-harae sessions were held to contain epidemics, such as smallpox, which could have been introduced by foreigners who were visiting Japan in large numbers by way of the Sea of Japan at the time,” said Shigeru Ohira of the Historical Institute of Hyogo Prefecture. Ohira also said that many hitogata dolls have been found along the coast of the Sea of Japan. But this doll’s face has the earlobes and chin wrinkles characteristic of the Buddhist deity Nyorai. Ohira thinks a religious center near the excavation site may have been responsible for the blending of elements of Buddhism and Shinto. "

Based on her analysis of the bones, archaeologist Rebecca Crozier of the University of Aberdeen has concluded that complete bodies were likely deposited in the chambered structures and then taken apart later. “When we look at these assemblages we're finding that all the elements of the human body—so, every single bone—is present at some level within the tomb,"" Crozier said.

In 2014, Falk studied endocasts of three Australopithecus africanus individuals, and one Australopithecus sediba , and suggested the impressions of brain folds left inside those braincases could indicate development in the areas of the brain involved in speech production. At the time, Falk said those creases were distinctly humanlike. However, in their new study, Falk and her colleagues analyzed MRIs of eight living chimpanzees, and found creases on the surfaces of their brains similar to the ones she had thought signified modern human–like brain organization in the ancient hominins. The study also found grooves in the brain of one of the chimps that correspond with a structure on a Homo naledi endocast that had been thought to be humanlike. Falk said her new research highlights the need for further study of living primates and how specific folds and creases on the surface of the brain relate to its inner structures. "

PANAMA CITY, PANAMA— Science Magazine reports that chemical analysis of the isotopes in animal bones unearthed in the ancient Maya city of Seibal determined which of the animals ate a diet rich in forest plant material, and were therefore wild, and which animals ate maize, and were therefore kept by humans. Archaeologist Ashley Sharpe of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute said dozens of turkeys, dogs, and one large cat that may have been a jaguar had all been fed maize-based diets. The bones of those dogs have been radiocarbon dated to between 450 and 300 B.C., making them the earliest known animals to have been domesticated by the Maya. These small, Chihuahua-like dog bones bore no signs of butchery, although Sharpe notes that doesn’t mean they weren't consumed. One pair of dogs from this period had isotope levels that suggested they had lived in Guatemala’s volcanic highlands before they were buried near a pyramid in Seibal’s central plaza. The cats, whose remains date to between 450 and 350 B.C., may have served a similar ceremonial use. The maize-fed turkeys lived between A.D. 175 and 950, at a time when dog remains became extremely scarce, indicating they could have replaced dogs as the Maya’s primary food source. "

The study indicates the lava flowed from the spring of A.D. 939 through the autumn of 940. These dates also correspond with records of haze, cold summers, and food shortages in Europe. Oppenheimer says the dates indicate that some of Iceland’s first settlers, and perhaps two generations of their descendants, may have witnessed and survived the cataclysm, and eventually translated their experiences, including the ensuing devastation and famine, into the Voluspá, a poem written around A.D. 961. It describes a volcanic eruption and meteorological events signifying the end of the island’s pagan gods and is credited with paving the way for the Christianization of Iceland. "

HERTFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND— BBC News reports that the foundations of the original A.D. 1077 apse were uncovered at St. Albans Cathedral under just three feet of soil. “One of our major aims was to confirm its presence and confirm the abbey was one of the early Norman cathedrals,” said Ross Lane, director of the excavation for the Canterbury Archaeological Trust. The excavation also uncovered approximately 20 graves dating to the eleventh and twelfth centuries. “They are clustered close to the walls in tile-lined tombs,” Lane said. The people in the graves are thought to have either lived in the abbey or been its benefactors in order to have received such honored burial spots. A new visitor center will be built on the site. "

WAIKAIA, NEW ZEALAND— The Southland Times reports that traces of a late nineteenth-century gold mine were found on New Zealand’s South Island by archaeology consultants engaged by the forestry company IFS Growth. The consultants first spotted the site, which is now covered over with heavy scrub, in historic aerial photographs. “To everyone’s surprise, we could see an extensive and largely intact gold mining complex consisting of water races, reservoirs, sluice workings, and sludge channels,” said Matthew Sole of Kopuwai Consulting. Miners’ huts were also part of the complex. Known as the Muddy Terraces site, the mine yielded as much as 42 ounces of gold during one five-week period, according to one newspaper account. Once the site’s boundaries have been determined, the forestry team will continue their harvest around it. "

CHANGSHA, CHINA— Xinhua reports that an unusual, horned eye-shaped bead was recovered from a tomb in southern China dating to the Warring States Period (475–221 B.C.). “It is in blue and white and incomplete, with only seven horns remaining around a base bead,” said Xi Peishen of the Hunan Institute of Archaeology. “It looks like the compound eye of a dragonfly.” The bead measures about an inch in diameter, weighs about an ounce, and may have been used as a decoration on clothes or furniture. Similar beads have been found in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, and India, and are thought to have been introduced to China through contact with West Asian civilizations during the Spring and Autumn period (779–476 B.C.). The tomb in which the bead was found is one of about 200 dating to the Warring States Period at the site. "
https://www.archaeology.org/news/6442-180316-middle-stone-age,Paleolithic,"Tool Discovery Pushes Back Onset of Middle Stone Age. WASHINGTON, D.C.—According to a Science News report, Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution and his colleagues suggest that early humans may have entered the Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The researchers analyzed soil samples taken from the Olorgesailie Basin of Kenya’s Rift Valley, and noted that frequent changes in the climate and earthquakes transformed the resources available to human ancestors. Erosion has destroyed about 180,000 years of the geological record at the site, but Potts said that during that time, there must have been a rapid period of evolution because lumps of pigment and new types of tools appear when the geological record resumed some 320,000 years ago. The toolmakers had shifted from sharpening large hand axes to making smaller tools, such as sharp flakes mounted on spears to be used as projectiles, and blades and points made from obsidian. Obsidian is not available locally, which suggests the toolmakers had to travel and perhaps interact with other human groups to obtain it. No hominid fossils have been found at the site, however, so researchers cannot be sure that Homo sapiens made the artifacts. "

Known as Iberomaurusians because they were thought to have come from the Iberian Peninsula, these hunter-gatherers made microliths similar to those of Europe’s Gravettian culture. But the genomic analysis suggests the people buried in the cave were related to Natufians, from the Middle East, with whom they probably shared a common group of ancestors who lived in North Africa or the Middle East more than 15,000 years ago. The team also detected DNA linked to sub-Saharan Africans in the bones from Grotte des Pigeons. This genetic material may have come from contemporaneous or ancestral migrants from the south. "

ORKNEY, SCOTLAND— The Scotsman reports that the site of an Iron Age feast has been found at The Cairns, on the island of South Ronaldsay. Martin Carruthers of the University of the Highlands and Islands said the bones of some 10,000 animals, including horses, cattle, red deer, and otters, have been found in a dump at the site, suggesting they had been cooked and eaten on the cliff overlooking Windwick Bay during a single event. Traces of metalworking have also been found at the site. Carruthers thinks the feast may have been held to celebrate the conclusion of making a big batch of brooches and pins, which may have been handed out to the members of the community during the party. A large building at the site may have been home to the people who organized the making of jewelry and the event. “These items are probably of such high value that people could never have the capacity to pay back the debt,” Carruthers surmised. “It holds you in your place. This whole event is about maintaining society.” "

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON—According to a report in New Scientist , a team led by Sharon Browning of the University of Washington has found evidence that modern humans and Denisovans interbred on the Asian mainland some 50,000 years ago. The Denisovans, an extinct hominin group, were identified from a finger bone discovered in Siberia’s Denisova Cave in 2010. Denisovan DNA has since been detected in modern Australasians, especially people now living in Papua New Guinea. In the new study, Browning and her colleagues examined the genomes of 5,600 people living in Europe, Asia, America, and Oceania, and detected Denisovan DNA in Han Chinese, Chinese Dai, and Japanese populations. “Although the Papuans ended up with more Denisovan ancestry, it turns out to be less similar to the sequenced Denisovan,” Browning explained. The study also indicates that there were at least two distinct populations of Denisovans living in Asia. "

Underwater archaeologist Mario Negri said four tunnels, a ten-foot-wide street, and a trench have been found. “It’s a discovery that opens up a new scenario for reconstructing the ancient structure of Palepolis,” he said. The region was first settled some 3,000 years ago by merchants interested in minerals in the surrounding landscape, and eventually became a trade center fought over by the Greeks and the Etruscans, until the well-fortified city of Neapolis was built to the south. By the time of the Roman Empire, Palepolis had become home to patrician villas on the outskirts of Neapolis. "

TEMPE, ARIZONA—According to a BBC News report, an international team of researchers has found evidence of human activity on the southern coast of South Africa, both before and after the cataclysmic eruption of Indonesia’s Mount Toba some 74,000 years ago. Both sites, one at a rock shelter and one in the open air on a beach, yielded shards of volcanic glass chemically fingerprinted to Mount Toba, which is located nearly 5,600 miles away. The scientists also found deposits of seashells from food preparation and stone flakes from toolmaking, and say the population of the groups that used these sites may have actually increased after the volcanic event, since they found an increase in the number of shells and stone flakes. It has been suggested that the eruption would have wiped out much of the global human population, but these coastal populations may have thrived after the ecological devastation, since they relied upon the sea for food. “We’re the first ones to really address the question of the Toba hypothesis in Africa,” said Curtis W. Marean of Arizona State University. “It’s in Africa that it really counts, because that’s the source location of modern humans.” "

YORK BEACH, MAINE—Last week, marine archaeologist Stefan Claesson examined the remains of a wooden ship’s hull that was exposed after up to eight feet of sand eroded from Maine’s Short Sands Beach during a storm. According to a report in Seacoast Online , the wreckage was first exposed in 1958, and was seen again in 2007 and 2103. During the latter two appearances, the Maine Historic Preservation Commission took the opportunity to map the hull, and learned it had been a 60-foot, flat-bottomed vessel, likely to have been built between 1750 and 1850. Such boats had narrow sterns and were used to carry goods along the coast from port to port. The researchers also learned that balsam fir, yellow birch, beech, and red pine had been used in the construction of the ship. In this most recent encounter with the wreckage, Claesson collected samples to send to a dendrochronology lab. A study of the tree rings could “hopefully shed some light on this, because no one knows the history of the ship for certain,” Claesson said. “This will be the first time that this kind of work has been done.” Claesson also brought a drone to the site to collect additional data and create a 3-D model of the wreckage.

Chief archaeologist Julie Schablitsky explained that the location of the site on an uneven hillock, which would not have been suitable for farming, and the regular pattern of fieldstones, which were often used to mark the graves of enslaved people, both suggest the presence of burials. Further research will attempt to identify who may have been buried there between 1736 and 1864, when slaves in Maryland were emancipated, but there are no plans to excavate. "

The city was founded by Emperor Trajan in the early second century A.D. in what is now northern Bulgaria to celebrate his victories over the Dacian tribes north of the Danube River. The Romans also built the reservoir and a 12-mile-long aqueduct to transport the water to the city’s western fortress wall. Chakarov said the octagonal-shaped reservoir was constructed of large stone blocks each weighing more than 1,000 pounds and held together with iron bars covered in lead. Four rows of those blocks have survived. “The water catchment reservoir has two openings—one in its northern end and one in its western end, giving the start to two canals,” Chakarov added. “The first one is the one sending water to Nicopolis ad Istrum, while the other one is a spillway sending the excess water to the main canal.” "

https://www.archaeology.org/news/6405-180228-chimp-bonobo-gestures,Pre-Human,"New Thoughts on Possible Hominin Communication. YORK, ENGLAND—Chimpanzees and bonobos both have repertoires of gestures that convey meaning to other members of their species. According to a report in Science Magazine , researchers led by Kirsty Graham of the University of York have concluded that about 90 percent of these gestures overlap between species and therefore were probably inherited. It is possible the apes developed the gestures independently, but the high correspondence suggests this is unlikely. Graham speculates that when humans see these gestures, many of them will also understand the meaning conveyed, suggesting the signals may have been passed down from the apes’ last common ancestor with modern humans. Further research will test how the gestures develop over an ape’s lifetime, and see whether people share any of the gestures. "

WARGRAVE, ENGLAND— The Henley Standard reports that construction work for a new church annex in a village in southeastern England has revealed human remains that appear to date from the early medieval period through the Victorian Age. As many as 90 individuals could be represented among the bones. “We can see many intercutting burials which cut through to the burial plot next to them,” said archaeologist Stephanie Duensing of John Moore Heritage. Remains of coffins and a shroud are helping the archaeologists date the remains, which are being cleaned in a shed at the site. Bone specialist Ceri Boston said she’s found evidence of scurvy, syphilis, arthritis, and poor dental health among the population. One man is thought to have been a bare-knuckle boxer due to a broken nose and rib fractures, though his unusual toe fractures also suggest he may have been a naval conscript. “They used to round up troublemakers and people in jail and shove them off to the navy,” Boston explained.

TAIYUAN, CHINA— Xinhua reports that a small, 1,500-year-old statue has been found in a small hole in one of the caves of the Yungang Grottoes. Wang Yanqing of the Yungang Grottoes Research Institute was conducting a survey of the Buddhist temples built in the fifth and sixth centuries into 53 major caves, and more than 50,000 niches, when he found the eroded statue. Measuring about six inches tall, the figure has wide shoulders, a muscular chest and abdomen, and outstretched arms. It had been placed in a small hole nearly 40 feet above the ground. “We guess the statue was carved by the craftsmen who cut the hole,” Wang said. “Due to its stealthy location, it was concealed when the wooden beams of the protective structures of the statue were plugged into the hole.” "

CAIRO, EGYPT—Kaled el-Enany, Minister of Antiquities, announced the discovery of a 26th-Dynasty (664–525 B.C.) cemetery in Middle Egypt, according to an Ahram Online report. So far, the excavation team has found a tomb belonging to Hersa-Essei, a high priest of the god Thoth. Thirteen burials were found in the tomb, along with around 1,000 faience ushabti figurines. Four alabaster canopic jars holding mummified organs of the deceased were also recovered. The lids of the well-preserved jars depict the faces of the four sons of the god Horus. The names and titles of the deceased were written on the jars. The excavation team also found the mummy of the high priest Djehuty-Irdy-Es, which was decorated with blue and red beads, gilded bronze sheets, a bronze collar depicting the god Nut with outstretched wings, and two eyes made of bronze, ivory, and crystal. Four amulets engraved with hieroglyphic texts and bearing semi-precious stones were also found on the mummy. A total of 40 limestone sarcophagi have been recovered to date.

BORDEAUX, FRANCE— Science News reports that cave art in Spain has been tentatively dated to at least 64,800 years ago through analysis of uranium in the mineral deposits covering the painted areas. Archaeologist Francesco d’Errico of the University of Bordeaux and his colleagues say the dates suggests the red horizontal and vertical lines and hand stencils were created by Neanderthals some 20,000 years before the arrival of modern humans in Europe. Possible jewelry made from eagle claws found in Croatia and pigment-stained seashells pierced with holes found in Spain have also been attributed to Neanderthals. “Neanderthal social life was as complex as that of [contemporaneous] humans in Africa,” said João Zilhão of the University of Barcelona. The scientists suggest the capacity for symbolic thinking could therefore have developed in a common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans some 500,000 years ago. "

CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS—According to a report in The Guardian , an international team of more than 100 scientists sampled DNA obtained from more than 400 prehistoric skeletons in order to study the spread of Beaker culture some 4,500 years ago. Archaeologists have long wondered if the telltale bell-shaped pottery marked the spread of culture through trade and imitation, or if the pottery was spread by mass migrations. Ian Armit of the University of Bradford said that on the European continent, the DNA samples the team extracted did not closely match those from Beaker burials, so Beaker culture probably did not travel with Beaker genes. But in Britain, the DNA of the people buried with beakers was different from the DNA obtained from earlier Britons, who may have been dying out before the arrival of the Beaker people. The oldest-known beakers have been found on the Iberian Peninsula, but DNA from burials there did not match the DNA found in Central Europe. “This is the first clear example from ancient DNA that pots do not always go hand-in-hand with people,” said David Reich of Harvard Medical School.

RZESZÓW, POLAND—Iwona Florkiewicz of the University of Rzeszów recently examined a spindle whorl unearthed more than 60 years ago in Czermno, a site in southeastern Poland, according to a report in Science in Poland . A spindle whorl adds weight to a spindle, prevents the thread from sliding off, and helps to maintain the spindle’s spin and control its speed. Florkiewicz said this whorl had been made of slate from what is now Ukraine. She also discovered that the whorl had been inscribed with Cyrillic letters. “Archaeologists probably did not expect spindle whorls to have inscriptions, so these objects were not analyzed in this respect,” she said. The letters spell the man’s name Hoten, and may have been a sign of ownership, or possible secondary use as an amulet. “The spindle whorl probably comes from the time when this area was a part of Kievan Rus,” she explained. “Remember that Czermno was a borderland town, where cultural influences from the east and the west mixed.” "

According to a report in Live Science , engineer Glen Dash thinks Egyptian engineers may have accomplished this feat by employing a shadow cast by a rod, or gnomon, on the fall equinox, when the sun shines directly on the equator and the length of day and night are nearly equal. Dash experimented with this possible technique by surveying with a rod and shadows on the fall equinox in Connecticut, and found that the degree of error was similar to that found in the alignment of the Egyptian pyramids. The sun and stars, or a combination of methods, may also have been used by ancient Egyptian engineers, he notes. "

Andrew Birley, director of excavations at Vindolanda, said Roman boxing gloves have been seen on statues and sculptures, but he thinks these gloves may be the only surviving examples from the period. The two gloves are thought to have been used for sparring, but were probably not a matched pair. They are of different sizes, and the smaller one contains a coil of hard, twisted leather, while the larger was filled with natural material that may have served as a kind of shock absorber. Gloves used in Roman boxing competitions are thought to have had metal inserts. "

CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND—A genetic study suggests at least one modern Caribbean population, on Puerto Rico, could be linked to the Taino, an ancient indigenous Caribbean group, according to a report in Science Magazine . Although oral history has long held that modern island populations are descended from indigenous people, it had previously been believed that all traces of the Taino were wiped out within 30 years of the arrival of Europeans in the Caribbean. Hannes Schroeder of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues were able to extract DNA for the study from a 1,000-year-old tooth recovered from a woman’s skeleton found in a cave on the hot, humid island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Pre-contact artifacts were found at the site as well. Comparison of the woman’s genome with those of other Native American groups revealed she was related to people who lived in northern South America and spoke Arawakan languages. Archaeologists have noted similarities between the ceramics and tools found at Taino sites and those in northern South America. And, the scientists say the archaeological and genetic evidence indicates the Taino traveled among the Caribbean islands frequently. “It looks like an interconnected network of people exchanging goods, services, and genes,” explained bioarchaeologist William Schaffer of Phoenix College.

LONDON, ENGLAND—According to a report in Live Science , additional pieces of a 2,600-year-old statue have been discovered in a temple dedicated to the Egyptian god Amun at the site of Dangeil, which is located along the Nile River in Sudan. Inscriptions written in Egyptian hieroglyphics on the newly uncovered pieces of sculpture have allowed archaeologists to identify the statue as depicting Aspelta, who ruled Kush between 593 and 568 B.C. The inscription describes Aspelta as beloved of the Egyptian sun god, and king of Upper and Lower Egypt, even though one of Aspelta’s predecessors had lost control of the country to the north some 100 years earlier. Julie Anderson, an assistant keeper at the British Museum, said Sudan’s kings may have kept the title of ruler of Upper and Lower Egypt “as general assertions of authority using the traditional titles, and not a claim to Egypt.” Based upon the pieces of Aspelta’s statue that have been found to date, the researchers estimate it stood approximately half life-size. The excavation is a project of the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, Sudan, in cooperation with the British Museum and is sponsored by the Qatar-Sudan Archaeological Project. "

DUISBURG, GERMANY— Science Magazine reports that volcano biologist Hardy Pfanz of the University of Duisburg-Essen and his colleagues measured the concentration of carbon dioxide emitted from the cave-like grotto at the temple dedicated to Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld, in Hierapolis. The visible mist still pours from deep fissures in the earth under the Plutonium into an open-air arena surrounded by raised stone seating. Pfanz and his team found that the warmth of the sun during the day dissipates the gas, but in the cool of the night, the gas, which is slightly heavier than the air, collects on the floor of the arena. At dawn, the concentration of carbon dioxide on the arena floor would have been strong enough to kill animals and people within a few minutes. Pfanz suggests the temple priests probably led bulls and other animals into “the gates of hell” for sacrifice in the morning, when their heads would not have risen above the layer of gas, while the priests themselves would have been safe. As the animals became dizzy, their heads would have dropped even lower into the carbon dioxide layer until they suffocated. "

Known as the Sunghir burials, the graves included the remains of two boys, aged ten and 12 years old, who had been buried together with more than 10,000 mammoth ivory beads, more than 20 armbands, some 300 pierced fox teeth, 16 ivory mammoth spears, carved artifacts, and deer antlers. In addition, two human fibulas had been laid across the boys’ chests. Trinkaus noted that a 40-year-old man had been buried with similar items, but far fewer of them. “From the point of view of the mortuary behavior, the burial of the adult is, in fact, very different from the burial of the children,” he said. The children’s skeletons suggest they had experienced periods of nutritional stress, and would not have been able to contribute to the highly mobile community in the way the full-grown man may have. The ten-year-old had short, bowed thigh bones, but he was physically active. The 12-year-old, however, had been bedridden, and the lack of wear on his teeth suggests he had been fed soft foods."

ITHACA, NEW YORK— Science News reports that bioarchaeologist Matthew Velasco of Cornell University examined the 600-year-old skulls of 211 members of Peru’s Collagua ethnic community, and found that intentional head-shaping of the young may have helped to bind together powerful elites. High-ranking elites are thought to have been buried in structures built against a cliff face, while non-elites were buried in caves and under rocky overhangs. Some of the bones and sediments were radiocarbon dated, so that Velasco could track how skull shapes changed over time. He found that about three-quarters of the 114 elite skulls dating to the late pre-Inca period, between A.D. 1300 and 1450, had been modified, and more than 60 percent of the modified skulls had been elongated. Velasco thinks the elongated style may have been preferred by elites, and speculates that their unity may have helped the Collaguas negotiate a peaceful integration into the Inca Empire. "

Some 8,000 years ago, the burial, now in a forested region, was at the bottom of a lake. The skulls of seven of the hunter-gatherer adults bore signs of partially healed blunt-force trauma. “Somebody gave them love and care after this [trauma] and healed them back to life again,” said Fredrik Hallgren of the Cultural Heritage Foundation in Västerås, Sweden. Two of the skulls, one of which contained a piece of brain tissue, were found mounted on wooden stakes that may have served as handles, and may have broken through the water’s surface after the skulls were placed on top of the large stones at the base of the burial site. The surviving brain tissue suggests the person was placed in the water shortly after death, but some of the other skulls may have been placed there long after the deaths of the individuals. The carefully arranged bones of wild boar, red deer, moose, and roe deer were also found. “It’s a very enigmatic structure,” Hallgren said. “We really don’t understand the reason why they did this and why they put it under water.” "

Kisir-Ashur described how he was trained, and his writings offer insights into how the Assyrians understood the concept of illness. “It’s an insight into some of the earliest examples of what we can describe as science,” Arbøll said. During the earlier stages of his education, Kisir-Ashur practiced his skills on animals, then progressed to treating babies, and finally adults. The texts also reveal that disease was thought to have been caused by sinful or objectionable behavior by the sick person, or the result of witchcraft performed against the sick person. After the power that caused the disease was identified, it was treated with medical agents, incantations, prayers, and rituals. Healers also treated economic and social problems, which were thought to have the same origins as illnesses. “He does not work simply with religious rituals, but also with plant-based medical treatments,” Arbøll added. Kisir-Ashur also experimented with the venom of scorpions and snakes, and observed patients who had suffered bites or stings. "

LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS—Veterinarian Luc Janssens of Leiden University recently examined the dog remains discovered in a Paleolithic grave in western Germany in 1914, and found that the younger of the two animals in the grave had suffered from canine distemper, according to a Live Science report. Analysis of the pup’s teeth revealed it had suffered from two or three bouts of the serious viral illness, which is marked by symptoms such as fever, lack of appetite, dehydration, fatigue, diarrhea, and vomiting in its first phase, to be followed by stuffy nose, laryngitis, and pneumonia. If a dog survives the second phase of the disease, it can then experience neurological problems and seizures. Janssens says the animal would have required intensive care from its human companions, and would not have been of any practical use as a working animal while it was ill. When combined with the fact that the dogs’ remains had been included in a human grave, which also contained a bone pin, a sculpture of an elk made from elk antlers, a bear’s penis bone, and a red-deer tooth, the pup’s condition suggests there had been an emotional bond of care between the species.

BERKSHIRE, ENGLAND— The Guardian reports that a section of a 5,500-year-old causewayed enclosure, complete with encircling ditches and boundaries with gap entrances, has been uncovered at a quarry in southeast England. Wessex Archaeology researchers expect to find the rest of the oval-shaped monument intact. “So that will mean we’ve got a much better picture and an understanding of the site as a whole,” said fieldwork director John Powell. The bones of deer, foxes, cattle, pigs, and sheep or goats, and deliberately smashed, decorated pottery suggest the site was used as a ceremonial gathering place. Residues in the pottery vessels will be tested to try to determine what they held. Leaf-shaped flint arrowheads, serrated blades, stone axes, and grinding stones have also been found at the site, which may have been a seasonally wet landscape on the floodplain of the Thames River at the time the enclosure was in use. Human remains have also been recovered at the site. Osteoarchaeologist Jaqueline McKinley said the skull and left femur had been removed from one body, and cut marks were found on a skull placed in the bottom of a ditch. “Some causewayed enclosures don’t contain much in the way of artifacts,” Powell said, “whereas this one seems very rich in artifacts, which will be significant for the understanding of the Early Neolithic in Britain.” "

His DNA, which was extracted from bone powder drilled from his skull, revealed that he probably had blue eyes, dark brown skin, and dark hair that may have been curlier than average. In addition, the genetic study revealed he was lactose intolerant, and was related to migrants who walked across Doggerland, a landmass that connected Britain to mainland Europe, about 11,000 years ago, making him an ancestor of present-day Britons. He was also related to other Mesolithic hunter-gatherers living in Spain, Luxembourg, and Hungary.

Previous analysis suggested the teeth had belonged to cattle or deer, but the new study indicates they belonged to a Neanderthal, and had been altered by the carnivore’s digestive juices. “We don’t know exactly what was going on,” said Alan Mann, a Princeton University professor emeritus, “but [the Neanderthals] must have left skulls or parts of the face there, because cave hyenas came in and ate them.” "

TUSCANY, ITALY— Science Magazine reports that 58 nearly identical charred wood objects have been found at the site of Poggetti Vecchi, in an area where Neanderthal artifacts have been found in the past. The items are thought to be digging sticks, which are used by modern-day hunter-gatherers to uncover roots and tubers, and to hunt small, burrowing animals. They can also serve as weapons when needed. The artifacts are about three feet long, rounded on one end, and sharpened on the other, and have been dated to some 171,000 years ago, when Neanderthals lived in the region. The tips of the sticks had been charred, perhaps as a way to remove the bark from the various hard woods, including boxwood, oak, ash, and juniper. The pattern of char is similar on a number of the sticks, which suggests it was intentional. The char marks could also be the earliest-known use of fire by Neanderthals. Cut marks on the shafts of the sticks suggest they had been shaped with stone tools. Some 200 stone tools were also found at the site, along with the fossilized remains of the extinct straight-tusked elephant. "
