CINCINNATI, OHIO\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by the University of Cincinnati , a team of scientists analyzed layers of sediments collected from ten reservoirs in the Maya city of Tikal, which is located in northern Guatemala. Founded in the third century B.C., the city was abandoned by the ninth century A.D., when a series of droughts occurred. The researchers detected toxic levels of cyanobacteria in the water near Tikal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central temple. Biologist David Lentz said consuming this water, even if it had been boiled, would have made people ill, especially during droughts. Algae blooms would have made the water look and taste bad anyway, added anthropologist Kenneth Tankersley. Mercury in the reservoir near the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s palace was traced to cinnabar, a red pigment used to paint murals and decorate buildings and pottery. When it rained, mercury is thought to have leached from the pigment and collected in the reservoir, since analysis of the sediment with energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry confirmed that the contamination did not come from the underlying bedrock, Tankersley said. The scientists concluded that Tikal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents are likely to have relied on other reservoirs in the city for uncontaminated drinking water, while the pools in the center of the city probably served as symbols of Maya rulers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 control over the water supply. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9020-200911-cambodia-lion-statue,South&Southeast Asia,\"Massive Lion Sculpture Uncovered in Cambodia.

It had been previously thought that the hundreds of figurines and jars, which were found in a jumble on the seafloor, were cargo on a Phoenician ship that sank in the Mediterranean Sea some 2,500 years ago. Edrey now suggests that the items, which vary in style, were deposited as offerings between the seventh and third centuries B.C. by members of a cult devoted to fertility and seafaring. Many of the figurines bear symbols associated with the mother goddess Tanit; dolphin symbols, which are also associated with Tanit; or depict a pregnant woman carrying a child. The researchers think the pottery may have been cast into the water as a ritual or a symbolic sacrifice. The position of the hands in some of the figurines, with the right hand upright and the left below the mouth, may indicate a vow in exchange for divine favor, Edrey added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9011-200909-norway-german-warship,Modern,\"World War II-Era German Shipwreck Found Near Norway.

The first burial, placed in the center of the circle, contained the remains of a possible chieftain, who had been placed in the grave on his side in a crouched position. The skulls and hooves of four cattle, a copper dagger with a whale-bone pommel, a stone wrist guard, an amber bead, and a flint and iron pyrite for starting fires were also found in the grave. The second grave, found near the first, held the remains of an older man placed in a seated position, and the skull and hooves of one animal. Radiocarbon dating of the burials indicates the men lived around 4,200 years ago, and the artifacts in both burials indicate the men might have been members of the Beaker culture. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne of the mysteries is, what was the relationship between those two men?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hood asked.

She analyzed bone-tipped arrowheads dated to the Paleolithic, and compared them to arrows known to have been used with poison, and arrows known to have been used without poison. Typically, arrows used with poison are smaller because they only need to reach an animal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bloodstream to deliver a deadly substance, while arrows used without poison must inflict a wound that will incapacitate or kill an animal. Lombard found that three out of six bone-pointed arrows recovered from South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Blombos Cave, dating to between 72,000 and 80,000 years ago, resemble poisoned arrowheads, and are so small that they would probably have been ineffective without an added poison punch.

Heating the stone would have given the toolmakers more control of the knapping process, but if done incorrectly, the rock would have broken and become unusable. Archaeologist Filipe Natalio of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and his colleagues evaluated two types of flint tools recovered from Qesem Cave with spectroscopic chemical analysis, and then heated flint samples in a laboratory oven in order to estimate the temperatures to which the ancient stones had been heated. They found that the blades had been heated to nearly 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while the flakes had been heated to 775 degrees. Pot lids recovered from the cave had been heated to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

About 30 percent of the oldest burials had elongated heads, while about 65 percent of the middle group and 70 percent of the last group showed signs of head binding. The researchers noted that the placement of grooves in the skulls changed over time, indicating that different binding techniques were used among different groups. Chemical analysis of the bones showed that some of the later residents had been born near the cemetery, while others had settled there after growing up somewhere else.

Located along the Silk Road, the village was home to the Oghuz, who were Turkic pastoralists. Ashleigh Haruda of MLU said the eighth-century tomcat had several healed broken bones, and had likely been fed by humans because it had lost all of its teeth. She added that the feline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remains were only recovered because the animal had been buried, in contrast to most of the other animal bones recovered from the site, which were found individually. In addition, the chemical composition of the cat bones indicates the animal was fed a diet that contained more protein than dogs whose remains have been found at the site, and to other cats that lived during the same time period. Finally, genetic analysis suggests the cat belonged to the domesticated species Felis catus Linnaeus . The keeping of a pet cat is thought to be an unusual practice for the Oghuz and may be a sign of cultural exchange brought about by contact with Silk Road traders, Haruda and her team concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8829-200629-washington-pipe-residue,Native American,\"New Plant Identified in 1,400-Year-Old Pipe in Washington.

NEWCASTLE, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by Newcastle University , Eric Tourigny examined more than 1,000 animal headstones in pet cemeteries in Newcastle and London in order to study changing attitudes toward pets over a period of 100 years, beginning in 1881, when the first public pet cemetery opened in London. Tourigny found that throughout the study period, mourners compared death to sleep. Yet in the Victorian era, headstone inscriptions referred to pets as companions and friends, while more recent inscriptions called the buried pets family members and expressed the hope that the animals would be reunited with their owners more frequently. After World War II, references to animals as family members rose, a change that coincided with the increase in the use of family surnames on pet gravestones. Some of the earlier references put the surname in parentheses or quotation marks. Tourigny suggests this reluctance to acknowledge pets as full members of the family may reflect a conflict between personal feelings and societal norms. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8528-200317-spain-hominin-maturity,Pre-Human,\"Study Suggests Hominins Grew Faster Than Modern Humans.

Hyksos architecture, artifacts, and burials resemble those found in the Near East, explained Chris Stantis of Bournemouth University. The study revealed, however, that 36 of the 75 people tested had lived in Egypt before the Hyksos came to power in 1638 B.C. The study also suggests that those who grew up somewhere other than Egypt probably came from a variety of places, and 30 of the immigrants were found to be female, Stantis added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe need to look more into who these women were and why they moved, but the fact that there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more women than men changes a lot of interpretations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stantis said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8881-200727-neanderthal-genome-pain,Pre-Human,\"How Did Neanderthals Experience Pain?. LEIPZIG, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94A new study of three Neanderthal genomes has found that they each carried three mutations on one gene on both sets of chromosomes that may have made the individuals predisposed to a heightened sense of pain, according to a Nature News report. Svante P\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4bo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology explained that while very rare in modern humans, the mutations, which are involved in altering the shape of a protein that carries painful sensations to the spinal cord and brain, may have been common in Neanderthals. P\\xc3\\xa4\\xc3\\xa4bo and his colleagues then looked for evidence of the Neanderthal mutation in a British database of modern genomes. None of the database participants had two copies of the mutated gene, as the Neanderthals did, but those who had one copy were about seven percent more likely to report having pain than people without the mutation. The researchers note that how the signal was processed in the spinal cord and brain would have also contributed to how Neanderthals experienced pain. Further study of additional Neanderthal genomes will investigate if the mutation might have been a beneficial adaptation. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6338-180209-ireland-book-of-kells,Medieval,\"New Thoughts on Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Book of Kells. DUBLIN, IRELAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a report in The Independent , Bernard Meehan of Trinity College, Dublin, has examined the Book of Kells , a 1,200-year-old illustrated copy of the four Christian Gospels, and offered new thoughts on its production. He thinks work on the four sections may not have begun at the same time, in Scotland, as had been previously thought. He says the handwriting of St. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel, which was copied on the Scottish island of Iona, indicates it was made by a traditional scribe educated during the mid-eighth century. The book, traditionally the last of the four Christian Gospels, may have been intended to stand alone, since it was especially revered by medieval Celtic Christians. The same scribe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handwriting has also been detected in the opening pages of St. Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel, however, suggesting that he may have died before completing that project. Meehan suggests a series of Viking attacks on the Scottish monastery, and possibly an epidemic, delayed production of the rest of the volume by about 50 years. Then, he believes, the remaining pages of St. Mark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel, and the entire texts of St. Luke\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel and St. Matthew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel, were produced in Ireland, after the monks had moved to the safer, inland site at Kells. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8846-200710-mesolithic-dental-health,Neolithic,\"Dental Decay Detected in Mesolithic Remains in Poland.

The battle is remembered today as the place where John Laurens, an aide-de-camp to George Washington, and friend of Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette, was killed. Laurens, 140 infantrymen, and artillery soldiers equipped with a howitzer attempted to secure a section of the Combahee River in order to prevent British soldiers stationed in Charles Towne from looting nearby farms. But the British learned of the plan and ambushed the Americans. General Mordecai Gist and his reinforcements were too late to save Laurens, but they caught up with the British, leading to a draw between the two sides. Yianopoulos and his team members used GPS technology and metal detectors to map the locations of dropped and fired musket balls and other artifacts, including an Irish halfpenny dated to 1775, a bayonet, and British grapeshot. They then compared this information to a map of the battle drawn by a British officer, and a lidar image of the surface of the ground, which revealed the locations of two small creeks recorded on the map.

Evershed explained that the method has been shown to produce dates accurate to within the span of a human life by comparing the dates obtained from fatty acids with dates obtained from charcoal, seeds, and bones, at sites in Britain, Europe, and Africa. For example, the team recently dated pottery fragments recovered in London\\xe2\\x80\\x99s East End to 5,600 years ago.

The ration included a can of Coca-Cola, chewing gum, and a can of stewed beef and vegetables. Susumu Kokubun, a member of the 1965 expedition of the Maritime Self-Defense Force, said his team leader, Masayoshi Murayama, traveled to the area near Mukai Rocks, where the food was found, in January 1966 in a helicopter that had been loaded on their icebreaker, The Fuji . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe may have left the food on that occasion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kokubun said.

The group of volunteer divers had been planning to document shipwrecks dated to the First and Second World Wars at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland when they spotted the wreckage of the Dutch three-masted ship. The shape of its hull and its lack of guns indicate the vessel was a fluyt, designed by the Dutch to carry twice the cargo of other ships.

Before the conquest, pigs were likely allowed to forage the countryside, but after the invasion, the animals were fed more protein, suggesting that farming practices intensified and pigs were kept in sties and fed scraps. The chemical composition of the bones of 36 men and women who lived between the tenth and thirteenth centuries indicates that they consumed about the same amount of protein and carbohydrate before and after the invasion, although there was a short period of dietary stress for a few years after 1066.

L.V. Lbova of Novosibirsk State University and Nikolay Drozdov of Siberian Federal University and their colleagues studied markings on the figurines and jewelry under a microscope in order to identify the tools that had been used to shape them. They then used those tools to recreate the objects and the markings. Chemical analysis of the ancient carvings indicates that the sculptures were painted with manganese and magnesium that was probably extracted from salt rocks located near the archaeological site. A figurine depicting a mammoth, for example, had been painted red on one side and black on the other. Layers of pigment on the beads suggest they were regularly repainted over many years. The researchers think that tool use studies could help them to identify the styles of individual master carvers, while a comparison of carving techniques between different archaeological sites in the region could offer information about relationships between the groups who once lived there. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9174-201029-maryland-slave-quarter,Modern,\"Possible Slave Quarter Uncovered in Maryland.

Founded in 241 B.C. and occupied until about A.D. 700, the walled city was located some 30 miles north of Rome and covered about 75 acres. By mapping the site at different depths, the researchers were able to see how the city evolved over time. In particular, the survey revealed a large rectangular building connected to water pipes that ran under city blocks to an aqueduct. This structure is thought to have served as an open-air pool in a public bathing complex. The researchers also detected a possible public monument made up of two large structures facing each other within a porticus duplex, a covered passageway with a central row of columns. Martin Millett of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues noted that the public buildings they detected in Falerii Novi were more elaborate, and the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s layout was less standardized, than expected, based upon previous studies of other small Roman cities. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9150-201020-france-lower-paleolithic,Paleolithic,\"New Study Redates Two Lower Paleolithic Sites in France.

These stone balls were made of dolomite or limestone, which is not found in the area, and they were covered with a different patina than other tools found in the cave, Assaf explained, which suggests the spheres were stored in another environment over a long period of time. Microscopic analysis of the artifacts revealed wear and tear on their ridges, as well as residues of fat, collagen, and bone. The team members recreated the spheres, and used the new tools to break open fresh animal bones.

COPENHAGEN, DENMARK\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Nature News report, an international team of researchers suggests that the virus that causes smallpox has been in the human population for about 1,700 years, or about 1,000 years longer than previously thought. The scientists screened DNA from the remains of 1,867 people who lived in Eurasia and the Americas between 32,000 and 150 years ago, and detected strands of DNA resembling the genetic makeup of the modern virus that causes smallpox in 26 of them. The researchers then extracted additional genetic material from the remains of 13 of these individuals for further study. Eleven of these individuals came from Scandinavia, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and their remains dated from between A.D. 600 and 1050. Evolutionary geneticist Martin Sikora said that four of these individuals carried a previously unknown strain of the virus. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a separate evolutionary trajectory that died out at some point and, as far as we know, is not present any more today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sikora said.

The oldest of the 130 bone projectile points are thought to have been used to hunt hard-to-catch monkeys, while longer points were eventually crafted to hunt larger pigs and deer. Notches and wear on the points indicate they were used in bow-and-arrow toolkits, the oldest-known weapons of this type to be found outside of Africa. More than 20 of the bone tools are thought to have been used to work animal skins and plant fibers, perhaps to make clothing to serve as protection from insect bites and diseases. It had been previously thought that early clothing was developed as a protection against cold weather. Some of the beads recovered from the cave were made from the pointed tips of marine snail shells, and are thought to have come to the site through trade with people living near the coast. Other beads in the collection are the oldest known to be made entirely of red ochre, the researchers explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8653-200424-ethiopia-medieval-church,Medieval,\"Medieval Church Site Investigated in Ethiopia.

The researchers found that there were already five distinct domesticated dog lineages some 11,000 years ago. Traces of these lineages can still be found in living dogs, such as the American lineage in Chihuahuas, and the Siberian lineage in Huskies. The study also suggests that wolf genes did not survive in domesticated dogs, even though wolves acquired dog genes. Larson explained that the introduction of wolf DNA into domesticated dogs could have produced poor guard dogs and hunting companions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a dog and you have a bit of wolf in you, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.

The scientists isolated the molecule responsible for producing the blue color, and analyzed it with mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and liquid and gas chromatography. Maria Jo\\xc3\\xa3o Melo of NOVA University Lisbon said the structure of the molecule, which has been named chrozophoridine, is unlike that found in indigo and other blue flowers and fruits.

Intact skeletons of the animals, lacking signs of butchery, have been discovered in individual burials from this period, she added. Butchered hare and chicken bones appear in the archaeological record hundreds of years later, among Roman-period food waste. At this time, Sykes said, hares were farmed for food, and the Romans introduced rabbits to the island, although hares and chickens continued to hold religious associations for Britons. After the Romans withdrew from Britain in A.D. 410, the populations of hares and chickens crashed, Sykes said, and rabbits went extinct. Scarcity may have increased their value among Britons, she added. In the medieval period, chickens and eggs became popular foods, since they were allowed within Christian fasting rules. Rabbits became an elite food item in the thirteenth century, and were widely found in Britain again by the nineteenth century, when they were associated with Christian Easter celebrations, Sykes concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8981-200826-hominin-teeth-diet,Pre-Human,\"Tooth Analysis Offers Clues to Timing of Hominin Adaptations.

The ship had 25 people onboard, including a reverend who was taken hostage by the Japanese and eventually beheaded. Several others died in the bombing or later that day, but 16 survivors made it to a tiny unnamed island and lived to tell the tale. The ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remains, however, have never been located. Archaeologist Michael Hermes and antiquarian Mike Owen from the heritage group The PastMasters discovered the crooked piece of Indonesian hardwood on Marchinbar Island. Owen believes it is a part of HMAS Patricia Cam \\xe2\\x80\\x99s hull called a knee that was used to hold up the floor of the hold, noting that its metal fixings perfectly match those used in the 1940s at the shipyard in New South Wales where the ship was built. A CT scan revealed bits of metal concentrated on one side of the piece of wood\\xe2\\x80\\x94possibly shrapnel from the blast that sank the ship. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9000-200903-roundworm-whipworm-infections,Medieval,\"Scientists Study Rate of Parasite Infections Over Time. OXFORD, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Science Magazine reports that zoologist Adrian Smith of the University of Oxford and his colleagues looked for the presence of the eggs of intestinal parasites in soil samples collected from the pelvic regions of 600 skeletons unearthed in the Czech Republic, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The burials were dated from the seventh century A.D. through the eighteenth century. The scientists found that the rate of parasitic infection among the individuals in the study stayed fairly stable over time: about 25 percent of them had been infected with whipworm, while about 40 percent were infected with the human roundworm. This rate of parasitic infection is similar to that found today in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico, South America, and East Asia, the researchers explained. The rate of parasitic infection among Europeans dropped by the beginning of the twentieth century, however, probably due to improvements in plumbing, hygiene, and sanitation, since the small, disease-producing worms spread through contact with soil, crops, and water supplies contaminated with infected feces. The scientists concluded that similar structural improvements around the world could wipe out modern parasitic infections. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8700-200518-norway-gjellestad-ship,Medieval,\"Viking Ship Burial Will Be Excavated in Norway.

LONDON, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Gizmodo reports that evidence unearthed at Chahak, an archaeological site in southern Iran, suggests that ancient Persians added a chromium mineral to their alloys to produce low-chromium steel in the eleventh century A.D. It had been previously thought that chromium steel, also known as stainless steel, was first produced in the twentieth century. Steel was produced at the site by placing a mixture of iron and other minerals, including about one to two percent chromium and two percent phosphorus, in long, tubular crucibles, which were sealed and warmed in a furnace. After the metal and crucible had cooled, the crucible was broken open and the ingot removed. The addition of chromium made the strong and hard metal, which was probably used to produce swords, daggers, and armor, according to Rahil Alipour of University College London. The phosphorus, however, added to reduce the melting point of the mixture, made it fragile. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChahak chromium crucible steel would have been similar in terms of its properties to modern tools steel,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Alipour said.

KYOTO, JAPAN\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Asahi Shimbun reports that researchers from the Kyoto City Archaeological Research Institute uncovered a castle wall and moat to the southeast of the Kyoto Imperial Palace. The structure is thought to have been completed by the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi in A.D. 1597, one year before his death. The surviving castle wall, which measures about 26 feet long and varies in height from three to five feet tall, is made up of three to four courses of stone. When intact, the wall probably stood about eight feet tall, based upon fallen stones discovered in the backfilled moat, estimated to have been about ten feet wide and eight feet deep. Gold-plated roof tiles bearing the family crest of the Toyotomi family were also recovered from the moat. Historian Kazuto Hongo of the University of Tokyo suggested that Toyotomi Hideyoshi built the castle as a way to pass his rank to his son and successors. Its careful construction was likely intended to inspire admiration in the nobles in the Imperial Palace, added researcher Soichiro Itagaki. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8864-200720-doggerland-tsunami-evidence,Neolithic,\"North Sea Sediments Offer Clues to Impact of Prehistoric Tsunami.

Kaare Lund Rasmussen and his colleagues measured the level of copper in 55 skeletons ranging from 200 to 1,200 years old that were recovered from nine cemeteries in rural and urban areas in Denmark and northern Germany. The researchers found high levels of copper in the bones of people who lived in towns during the Viking and medieval periods, which they believe came from copper pots scraped by metal cooking utensils. Acidic foods stored in copper vessels may have absorbed the metal as well, Rasmussen explained. People who lived in rural areas did not ingest enough copper for it to be detectable in their bones, however. Rasmussen suggests country-dwellers were likely to have prepared their food in pots made of other materials, despite the popular historic image of a country kitchen equipped with a copper pot.

Long celebrated in the West as a great victory, the battle took place on September 7, 1191, when England\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Richard I, or Richard the Lionheart, led his forces against an army commanded by the great Muslim military leader Saladin. The exact location of the battlefield has since been lost. To recover it, Lewis studied a combination of historical and environmental records, and analyzed a network of medieval-era roads to identify an area north of Tel Aviv as the likely site of the battle. A limited survey of the area with a metal detector led Lewis to unearth Crusader-era artifacts, including two arrowheads and a horseshoe dating to the late twelfth or early thirteenth centuries. While the Battle of Arsuf is celebrated as a great victory by European sources, Lewis points out that the Crusaders failed to recapture Jerusalem, the main objective of their campaign. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8526-200317-turkey-istanbul-graves,Modern,\"Graves of Ottoman Soldiers Unearthed Near Istanbul.

The cave is known for its hundreds of Paleolithic engravings depicting animals and humans. The researchers determined from their observations that the human remains, which rest in three locations within the cave, had been placed in hollows dug out and abandoned by hibernating bears. Two of those so-called nests had been covered with red ochre before the human remains were placed there. All of the remains belonged to teenagers and adults, and some of the skeletons were incomplete. For example, in some of the nests, no crania were found, although the teeth had been left behind, Schotsmans noted, suggesting that the people who used the Grotte de Cussac had manipulated the remains. In addition, the researchers noticed that the remains of some of the individuals had been intermingled. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8539-200324-new-york-settlements,Native American,\"Direct Dating of New York Settlements Offers New Timeline.

Because Europeans traveled by river from the coast into New York in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, timelines for Native American settlement of these areas had relied upon the arrival of European goods such as metal items and glass beads. But Manning noted that not all Native American groups accepted contact or goods from Europeans. The researchers thus analyzed metal goods from the settlements with portable X-ray fluorescence to see if they may have been crafted from local materials, collected new radiocarbon dates of organic materials such as maize kernels, and conducted a statistical analysis of archaeological and historical information. The results of the study suggest that the shift to larger, fortified communities at some Iroquoian sites did not occur in the mid-fifteenth century, as previously thought, but between the mid-sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9004-200904-europe-lactase-persistence,Bronze Age,\"Genetic Study Traces Development of Lactose Tolerance.

The study found that only about one in eight of the dead were able to digest the lactose in milk, some 4,000 years after dairy farming had been introduced to Europe. Population geneticist Joachim Burger said that people who live in the region today have genomes largely similar to those buried along the Tollense River, but about 90 percent of them are able to digest milk sugar. Daniel Wegmann of the University of Fribourg said that for such a change to have taken place in just 3,000 years, lactase-persistent individuals must have had more children, or their children must have had a better chance of survival than those who did not carry the genetic adaptation. Burger explained that milk provides energy, and could be less contaminated than drinking water, which may have been a decisive factor in the survival of young children after they were weaned from mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s milk. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8976-200824-universal-facial-expressions,Pre-Columbian,\"Maya and Olmec Sculptures Aid Study of Emotional Expressions.

Previous comparisons of facial expressions of living people have been questioned because of the far-reaching influence of modern Western cultural practices. The new study presented more than 300 English-speakers with photographs of just the faces of sculptures made in Mexico and Central America between 3,500 and 600 years ago, and asked them to assess the statues\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expressions according to a list of 30 emotions or emotional states.

More than 100 other participants were asked to rate how people in those same situations would express the same emotions or emotional states. The study found that the sculptures\\xe2\\x80\\x99 facial expressions aligned with what the participants expected to see, and suggests that humans may have evolved a wider set of facial expression to convey more emotions that had been previously thought. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8547-200326-colorado-internment-camp,Modern,\"Japanese Internment Camp Considered for National Park Status.

Sonar 3-D images and video collected with two remotely-operated unmanned submarines reveal the damage sustained by the submarine when it was rammed by Patrol Boat HMS P-57, which had been fitted with a strengthened bow. The Royal Navy vessel then dropped depth charges on the sunken submarine over a period of several days. Both technologies were developed to fight German U-boats and the plan to prevent the British from transporting coal, steel, timber, and cement by sea. German naval officials suggested after the war that Royal Navy divers had entered the UC-47 to retrieve intelligence documents, including a map of German mines laid against British shipping, but Pacheco-Ruiz said the wreckage rests under more than 150 feet of water, making such an operation unlikely. He thinks the crew of P-57 may have dropped the multiple depth charges in an effort to create holes in the wreckage so that documents could float to the surface.

Driving the buffalo up the steep embankment and confining them there would have made them easier targets for hunters traveling on foot and equipped with bows and arrows. Stone points have been found among the bones, Pelton added. The people who hunted here, he said, lived in semipermanent seasonal camps and had a trade network that extended to the Pacific Ocean. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8855-200715-mexico-axayacatl-courtyard,Pre-Columbian,\"15th-Century Palace Flooring Unearthed in Mexico City.

Ust-Kyakhta, the Siberian site where the tooth was found, is situated between Lake Baikal and the Mongolian border, or about 2,800 miles from Beringia, a land bridge that connected eastern Siberia to the Americas until it was submerged by glacial melt around 11,000 years ago. Some 2,000 miles away from Ust-Kyakhta, in northeastern Siberia, researchers have found the remains of a Mesolithic woman whose genome shares about two-thirds of its DNA with living Native Americans. When combined, the information suggests that Native American ancestors came from a wider region than previously thought.

Such ink slabs usually have hollows where the ink was rubbed and traces of blackish residue. Yanagida noted that pottery from Lelang, a Han Dynasty administrative center established by China on the Korean Peninsula in 108 B.C., has also been found at the Japanese site of Mikumo-Iwara, an ancient capital mentioned in a Chinese record of encounters with Japan. An ink slab dated to the first or second century A.D. was discovered at Mikumo-Iwara in 2016.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK\\xe2\\x80\\x94 NPR reports that U.S. federal prosecutors have filed a civil complaint in the Eastern District of New York seeking the repatriation of a 3,500-year-old cuneiform tablet fragment to Iraq. The so-called Gilgamesh Dream Tablet measures about five inches by six inches. In the text on the fragment, the hero of the Gilgamesh epic describes his dreams to his mother, who interprets them for him. The government of Iraq is now trying to determine if the tablet fragment was among the thousands of artifacts stolen from regional museums during war and unrest in 1991. According to the civil complaint, the tablet surfaced in London around 2001, and was eventually sold to an American collector in a private sale in 2014. The artifact was later seized by the federal government and is now housed in a Department of Homeland Security warehouse. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9146-201016-canada-ontario-village,Native American,\"Iroquoian Woodland Village Site Discovered in Ontario.

Achaemenid invasion of Egypt. According to historians such as Diodurus Siculus and Strabo, King Cambyses II attacked Egypt after massing a huge army on the plains near the city of Acre. The team, led by Ben-Gurion University archaeologist Gunnar Lehmann and David Schloen of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, believe that Tel Keisan was probably one of several outposts that played a role in supporting the Persian expeditionary force during its build up. The Persian-period fortifications at Tel Keisan were later heavily damaged during Alexander the Great\\'s fourth-century B.C. campaign to drive the Achaemenids out of the Levant. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8542-200324-new-hampshire-canoe,Native American,\"Dugout Canoe Dated in New Hampshire.

Around A.D. 1050, the village of Cahokia began to expand rapidly into a city where as many as 10,000 people lived. In addition, archaeobotanist Mary Simon said that some 2,000 years ago, it would have been very difficult to grow corn, which had originally been cultivated in Mesoamerica, in what is now the Midwestern United States because of the difference in the amount of available sunlight. It would have taken time for the plant to evolve and adapt to the new environment, she explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9415-210202-chumash-shell-bead,Native American,\"Shell Bead Study Pushes Back Use of Currency in California.

Historical descriptions note that the battle occurred along the Tagus River, which stretches some 625 miles from the mountains of eastern Spain to Portugal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Atlantic coast. The researchers argue that Hannibal would have chosen to travel to his winter quarters along an ancient route that connected central Spain to the southeast, and would have crossed the Tagus River close to the town of Driebes and the Carpetani-fortified settlement of Caraca. Hannibal is said to have built a defensive wall near the river and placed his cavalry at shallow areas to force the Carpetani to cross in deep, fast-moving waters to avoid his soliders.

He describes one of the objects as a small, flat pebble bar with two small holes carefully carved on its surface. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8849-200713-string-shell-jewelry,Pre-Human,\"String Marks Detected on 120,000-Year-Old Painted Shells. TEL AVIV, ISRAEL\\xe2\\x80\\x94Microscopic examination of five 120,000-year-old clamshells unearthed in Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Qafzeh Cave detected striations around naturally occurring holes near their tops, according to an Ars Technica report. Daniella Bar-Yosef Mayer of Tel Aviv University and her colleagues suggest the marks indicate the shells once hung on a string. Additional wear around the edges of the shells may have been caused by the shells rubbing against each other. Four of the shells also retained traces of red ochre. The team members created their own shell jewelry and experimented with strings made from different kinds of fibers. They found that the marks left by string made with flax matched the marks on the prehistoric shells. Because 160,000-year-old shells from Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Misliya Cave do not carry similar marks, Bar-Yosef Mayer and her colleagues suggest string was invented sometime between 160,000 and 120,000 years ago. The invention of string, she explained, would have led to raft-building, fishing nets, and more complicated animal traps, clothing, and bags. It is still not clear, however, if string was invented by modern humans or Neanderthals, she concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8673-200505-mexico-tejuino-jars,Pre-Columbian,\"Pottery in Mexico Yields Traces of Corn Beer.

The urns are estimated to be between 500 and 700 years old. Archaeologist Rodrigo Esparza L\\xc3\\xb3pez of the College of Michoac\\xc3\\xa1n said chemical analysis of the residues revealed boiled starches from maize and sweet potato, which may have been added to the corn beverage for their high sugar content in order to boost fermentation. The other jars may also have been used to ferment, cook, and store tejuino, or store water or grain, he added. The large vessel was reassembled by students at Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Western School of Conservation and Restoration (ECRO) over the past 12 years. They found that about 85 percent of it had been preserved, and it weighed about 220 pounds. Full of liquid, the vessel would have weighed more than 400 pounds.

GAMBIER, OHIO\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Science News reports that a fragment of string made of twisted inner tree-bark fibers has been found on a stone tool unearthed at a Neanderthal site in southeastern France by Bruce Hardy of Kenyon College and his colleagues. The tool was recovered from sediment dated to between 52,000 and 41,000 years ago in the Abri du Maras rock shelter, where individual twisted fibers had been recovered in the past. Now measuring less than one-quarter of an inch long, the string may have fastened the tool to a handle, or it may have been woven into a bag that held the tool, the researchers explained. Neanderthal string-makers would have had to understand mathematical concepts and the growth cycles of trees, they added. The previously oldest-known piece of string, made of twisted wild flax fibers and dated to about 32,000 years ago, was discovered in western Asia. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9038-200918-north-carolina-artifacts,Modern,\"Eighteenth-Century Artifacts Unearthed in North Carolina.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\\xe2\\x80\\x94A new study of fossils from Ethiopia suggests that more than three million years ago, Australopithecus afarensis children needed care for an extended period of time, according to a Science News report. It had been previously thought that the small size of infant heads and an extended period of brain development evolved some 2.5 million years ago, in order to accommodate a pelvis adapted to upright walking in the Homo genus of human ancestors. Philipp Gunz of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and a team of researchers scanned the insides of the skulls of six Australopithecus afarensis adults and two children under the age of three at the time of death with synchrotron-computed tomography to examine imprints left by brains, compute their volume, and see how they were organized. Today, modern human brains have a larger prefrontal cortex, and reach adult size at about the age of five, while the brains of chimpanzees and other apes have a smaller prefrontal cortex and reach adult size between the ages of two or three. The study revealed that the organization of the Australopithecus afarensis brains was similar to that of chimpanzees, but their rate of brain growth was more like that of modern humans. Gunz said such an extended period of childhood brain growth might have lowered an infant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nutritional requirements, making a child easier for a mother to feed. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9050-200923-ireland-medieval-monastery,Medieval,\"Medieval Monastery Excavated in Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s County Meath.

The monastery was equipped with a communal latrine, a water system, and a cellar to support between 30 and 50 monks. Previous investigation of the site revealed French jugs and ceramic roof tiles, suggesting the site was inhabited by French Cistercians from Normandy known as De Bello Becco. The monastery also had a gatehouse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were lucky to find waterlogged deposits which preserved a lot of timber and seeds for us so we can tell by the flat oats and cereal that the monks made and ate sourdough bread,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stout said.

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Science News report, molecular biologist Oded Rechavi of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues analyzed animal DNA obtained from 26 Dead Sea Scroll fragments in order to study the possible origins of the ancient parchments. After they excluded the DNA left behind by people who handled the scrolls, the researchers determined that two of the fragments were made from cowskin, and the rest were made from sheepskin. Further analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA indicates that eight of the fragments came from closely related sheep, which suggests these documents were all produced in the same place. Previous research of spelling and other elements of the written tradition had indicated that seven of these fragments originated in the Qumran community. Team member Noam Mizrahi pointed out that cows were not raised in the Judean desert, so cowskin scrolls probably originated somewhere other than Qumran. A Qumran fragment from the biblical book of Isaiah was determined to have come from a group of sheep distinct from the Qumran sheep, and so may also have been produced at an unidentified site. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8728-200601-norway-ship-burial,Medieval,\"Second Viking Ship Burial Detected on Norway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Edoya Island.

The first ship burial, now known as the Edoya ship, was detected on the small island last fall. Manuel Gabler of the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) said the data indicates an object about 24 feet long and three feet wide had been placed inside a circular structure thought to be a round stone cairn. NIKU researcher Knut Paasche added that the long object probably represents the bottom of the boat, and the full vessel would have been long enough to have been propelled by four pairs of oars. The survey also detected a round anomaly in the soil that may have been a burial mound that has been plowed over, two more possible graves, and what could be traces of two houses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe houses that have been traced may well be from the older Iron Age, circa A.D. 300 to 600,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained county conservator Bj\\xc3\\xb8rn Ringstad. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tombs may be from the younger Iron Age, circa A.D. 600 to 900.

In particular, they looked at the animals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosomes, and DNA markers linked to coat color, and found that genetic patterns associated with domestication appeared suddenly in the Anatolian horses around 2000 B.C. If horses had been domesticated in Anatolia, Guimaraes explained, the traits would have been acquired gradually. The imported horses then bred with local wild Anatolian horses and donkeys, producing mules between 1100 and 800 B.C.

Toby Driver of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales said the sites offer a glimpse of Rome\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military might during the 20-year fight to conquer Celtic tribes in the region. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is when Wales is still a very dangerous place to be for the troops, they are still under attack,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. One of the forts, located to the west of the Roman town of Caerwent and the Roman legionary fortress at Caerleon, had an inner and an outer defensive structure. The zone in between would have allowed Roman soldiers to attack the enemy with javelins. The Roman marching camp, the third to be identified in Wales, served as a temporary overnight stop with defensive positions and kitchens for soldiers traveling through hostile territory.

Analysis of lesions on the skull with a CT scan indicate that it had been deliberately removed from the body, and its soft tissues scraped away, a funerary practice observed in other Neolithic burials in the region. The skull is thought to have belonged to a woman who was between the ages of 24 and 35 at the time of death. Other marks on the skull suggest she had suffered a head wound that had healed. Grooves below this wound may have may been made with tools during a surgical procedure. Red ochre on the skull may have been placed there as a medicine or for symbolic reasons, the scientists explained. Tiny holes in the bone may be related to inflammation from chronic anemia, and two dense spots are thought to be benign tumors. Finally, possible childhood health problems are recorded in her underdeveloped tooth enamel, while several dental cavities suggest she ate a diet high in carbohydrates.\"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8533-200319-little-foot-skull,Pre-Human,\"\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLittle Foot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fossils Examined with High-Tech Tools.

Nielsen and his colleagues returned to the site, which had since been drained, and uncovered the ancient seabed and piles of bluefin tuna bones, cod bones, small whale bones, arrowheads, fishhooks, and harpoons. The researchers suggest that while hunting large fish from boats, some of the prey may have been injured but not recovered by the hunters, or may be the remains of fish that were cleaned in the boats and thrown overboard. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be an incredible coincidence if these rare harpoons and fish bones were just randomly collected there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nielsen explained.

NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a BBC News report, research conducted by Hannah Durkin of Newcastle University has identified Matilda McCrear as one of the last survivors of the transatlantic slave trade. Captured by slave traders in West Africa at the age of two, McCrear arrived in Alabama on the slave ship Clotilda in 1860. The ship is thought to have been scuttled shortly after its arrival in Mobile Bay in an effort to destroy evidence of the journey, because the importation of slaves to the United States had been outlawed in 1808. McCrear, her mother, and one of her three sisters who made the journey were purchased by the same plantation owner, Memorable Walker Creagh. After the abolition of slavery in the United States in 1865, the family worked as sharecroppers. Durkin said McCrear changed her surname, and had a common-law marriage with a white German-born man. They had 14 children. At the age of 70, McCrear was interviewed by the Selma Times-Journal after she and Sally \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRedoshi\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smith, another Clotilda survivor, made a claim for compensation for their enslavement at the county courthouse, which was dismissed.

Sneed looked for evidence of ramps in published excavation reports and visited ancient Greek sanctuaries, focusing on fourth-century B.C. sites dedicated to Asclepius, the Greek god of healing. Sneed said she found evidence of ramps at some sanctuaries that had not been included in excavation reports. For example, Sneed totaled 11 ramps at the main Asclepius sanctuary complex at Epidaurus. A broad stone ramp led to the main temple, while two additional ramps led through the sanctuary gates. Smaller side buildings at the site were also equipped with ramps wide enough for a single walker. The ramps, Sneed explained, would have made it easier for people who walked with crutches or canes, and would also have aided those who were carrying disabled individuals on litters or stretchers. In contrast, she added, just two ramps were found at the massive Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe distribution is pretty clear: They show up in places where there are more disabled people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sneed concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8719-200527-bulgaria-greek-inscription,Roman,\"Ancient Greek Inscription Discovered in Bulgaria.

However, the researchers note, this Y chromosome came from a modern human population that migrated out of Africa and then went extinct. Kelso explained that the modern human Y chromosome may have offered Neanderthals a genetic advantage, especially after modern human mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child, entered Neanderthal populations some 220,000 years ago.

It had been previously suggested that all of the structures were built over time, but Haklay and Gopher suggest the construction of the oldest buildings at the site was planned as a single project. The analysis revealed, Haklay explained, that the centers of three of the stone circles were placed roughly midway between their central pillars. Those three points, when linked, are within about ten inches of forming an equilateral triangle with sides measuring about 63 feet long. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe enclosures all have different sizes and shapes so the odds that these center points would form an equilateral triangle by chance are very low,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Gopher added that the project would have required the labor of at least hundreds of people and could mark the beginnings of stratified society. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9006-200908-mexico-mammoth-skeletons,Paleolithic,\"More Mammoth Skeletons Uncovered in Mexico.

On December 7, 1862, Union troops engaged Confederate troops that had set up a defensive position at a farm owned by Archibald Borden. More than 2,500 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed in the ensuing battle, and although the fighting was tactically indecisive, the Confederates withdrew from the position, and the Union gained control of northwestern Arkansas. Matt Mulheran, a park interpreter at Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park, said that before archaeologists could begin the survey, six acres of park land around Borden House were cleared of trees and underbrush to re-create the historic landscape. Michael Evans of the University of Arkansas added that archaeologists have to determine which artifacts at the site date to the Civil War, and which were left behind by Civil War reenactors and the television production The Blue and the Gray , which filmed at the site in the early 1980s. Evans explained that so far, the researchers have found nineteenth-century objects, including bullets and artillery shells, in unexpected places. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to how it may rewrite the narrative of the battle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8566-200402-mexico-artifact-preservation,Pre-Columbian,\"Underwater Artifacts Returned to Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Lake of the Moon.

The objects were discovered in the lake in 2007, and were kept in similar underwater conditions for the past 13 years while they were studied. Most of the 52 possible ritual items in the collection are spherical or conical in shape and made of the resin of the copal tree. The conical artifacts measure between eight and 12 inches tall, and may have been intended to resemble the volcano, according to INAH archaeologist Iris Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez. The spherical objects are about the size of a baseball, she added. Carbon dating of the objects indicates they were made between A.D. 1216 and 1445, when the Matlatzinca people ruled the Valley of Toluca.

These characteristics had previously only been noted in Neanderthal adults. To see if Neanderthal children shared the same stocky build or developed it as they grew, the researchers digitally reconstructed the rib cages of four Neanderthal children ranging in age from a couple of weeks to 2.5 years old. Their partial skeletons were found in France, Syria, and Russia, and dated to between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe stocky body shape of Neanderthals not only passed from parents to children, but also probably passed from ancestral species to their Neanderthal descendants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Garc\\xc3\\xada-Mart\\xc3\\xadnez concluded.

The Nazis closed the camp in 1944 and systematically destroyed many of its records. The researchers surveyed the site with remote-sensing technology and examined the surviving vegetation-covered structures. They found that the prisoners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 barracks offered only five feet of space per person, and would have offered little protection from wind and cold, in contrast to buildings occupied by Nazi guards, which were constructed with reinforced concrete and stone to withstand air raids.

Feasters are thought to have traveled to Crystal River to conduct religious ceremonies and ritual burials containing distinctly decorated ceramics, arrange marriage alliances, and enjoy meals of deer, alligator, shark, and other delicacies. In contrast, those who later gathered at Roberts Island ate mostly oysters, perhaps reflecting lower sea levels and cooler, dryer conditions.

Known as watercourts, the pens, made of oyster shells and sediment, opened into the canal which bisects the island. The researchers suggest that once a school of fish had been driven from the canal into a watercourt, the pen could have been closed off with a gate or a net. Fish bones and scales at the site suggest mullet, pinfish, and herring were among the catch. Evidence of fires and post molds near the structures may be the remains of racks for drying and smoking fish. Geologist Michael Savarese of Florida Gulf Coast University said that the amount of organic material in the soil indicates that the watercourses had poor water circulation, and were probably only used for short-term storage while the catch was processed. Such fishing practices would have allowed the Calusa to create a surplus of food to feed large numbers of workers who were otherwise occupied with the construction of canals, shell islands, and large buildings, the researchers explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8556-200331-lene-hara-cave,Paleolithic,\"Possible Pleistocene Rock Art Discovered in East Timor. SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Cosmos Magazine report, Christopher Standish of the University of Southampton and his colleagues have found traces of poorly preserved hand stencils and pigment splatters in the Lene Hara Cave, which is located on the eastern side of the island of Timor. Standish said the paintings, which probably date to the Pleistocene, were made by blowing red pigment over a hand placed on a mineral crust. The mineral crust has since flaked off the cave walls, leaving behind faint patterns only visible through enhanced photography. It had been previously suggested that all known rock art in East Timor dated to the Holocene, which began about 11,650 years ago, but Standish and his team members note the stylistic differences between the stencils and other images on the cave walls. The later paintings feature geometric shapes and images of animals, and in one case, had been painted over an older hand stencil, he explained. The researchers suggest that migrants traveling by water some 65,000 years ago may have stopped at the site before arriving in Sahul, the ancient landmass made up of what are now Australia, Tasmania, and New Guinea. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe rock art we uncovered could be critical for understanding the colonization and spread of ideas between Asia and Sahul,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Standish said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8807-200619-india-buried-temple,South&Southeast Asia,\"Sand Mining Reveals Temple in Southeastern India.

The radiocarbon dates suggest that many of the bone artifacts belonged to contemporaries of the grave occupants, while the micro-computer tomography scans revealed that some of the bone artifacts came from cremated remains, some of the bones had been exhumed after burial, and other came from bodies that were allowed to decompose on the surface of the ground. Thomas Booth of the University of Bristol said the varied treatment of the remains indicates there was no established protocol for the treatment of bodies whose bones would be preserved as keepsakes. These people may have been played an important role in the community, or they may have been family members, friends, or even enemies.

BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) , a team of researchers led by Axel Timmermann of the IBS Center for Climate Physics created a supercomputer model to simulate possible scenarios for the collapse of Neanderthal populations between 38,000 and 43,000 years ago. The migration of Neanderthals and modern humans, their interactions and interbreeding, and the rapidly fluctuating climate of the period were all taken into account, Timmermann said. The results produced by the computer model were then compared with anthropological, genetic, and archaeological data. The scientists concluded that competition with modern humans alone was responsible for the extinction of the Neanderthals. Possible reasons for the modern human advantage may have been better hunting techniques, stronger immune systems, or higher birth rates, Timmermann added, while pointing out that Neanderthals survived in Eurasia for 300,000 years only to go extinct around the same time that modern humans arrived on the scene. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8554-200330-rhode-island-cemetery,Modern,\"Historic African American Cemetery Mapped in Rhode Island.

The poorly preserved mummy of a girl, aged approximately 15 years old at the time of death, was found resting on her side inside the coffin. She was wearing two spiral-shaped earrings coated with metal in one ear, and two rings, one made of bone and the other of metal, string, and a blue glass bead. A total of four necklaces fastened together with a faience clip rested on her chest. One of the necklaces was made of amethyst, carnelian, amber, blue glass, and quartz beads. The small mud coffin contained a wooden ushabti figurine wrapped in four linen bandages.

The presence of a Homo heidelbergensis shin bone suggests that a group of the possible human ancestors had gathered at the site to butcher a horse carcass. More than 2,000 flintknapping scatters, found in eight separate areas of the site, were reassembled by the researchers, who found that each pile had been left behind during the shaping of a biface knife. These implements were then probably used to butcher the horse. The animal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flesh was removed, and its bones were smashed to remove marrow and grease, creating enough food to feed as many as 40 people. Marks on some of the horse bones indicate that they were used as retouchers to continue to shape the flint knives.

The massive cave deposit includes remains of mussels, limpets, crabs, sharks, fish, eels, seals, dolphins, and marine birds.

It had been previously thought that the cognitive abilities of modern humans alone benefited from the consumption of these nutrients. But the discovery of a massive deposit of marine foods at a Neanderthal site offers additional evidence that Neanderthals and modern humans were very similar to each other. The cave also contained stone tools, traces of roasted plants, and the bones of horses and deer. Some 100,000 years ago, Zilh\\xc3\\xa3o added, the cave was set back about one mile from the coastline, indicating that Neanderthals must have made baskets or bags in order to carry large quantities of shellfish to the shelter.

Previous attempts to understand the system of fractions were complicated by damaged documents and the contradictory use of certain signs\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps because the system changed over time. The researchers therefore limited the study to documents dated to between 1600 and 1450 B.C. They then combined the study of the fraction sign shapes and their use in inscriptions with statistical, computational, and typological strategies to assign them mathematical values. After excluding impossible outcomes, the computation yielded nearly four million possible solutions. Typological data were then used to compare the results with fractions commonly found in use in history. Statistical tests also helped to trim the list of possibilities. Ferrara and her team concluded that Linear A\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lowest fraction was 1/60. The study also suggests that the Linear B script used by Mycenaean Greek culture between 1450 and 1200 B.C. reused some of these fractions as units of measurement. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9053-200925-italy-repatriation-turkey,Iron Age,\"Italy Hands Over Stolen Ancient Artifact to Turkey.

Population geneticists David Reich and Nathan Nakatsuka of Harvard University, paleogenomicist Lars Fehren-Schmitz of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and their colleagues note that genes flowed between these groups in the Andes, and with populations living outside the Andes, but the exchanged slowed about 2,000 years ago. These regional genetic differences persist today, they added. This genetic continuity suggests that the fall of Andean cultures such as the Moche, Wari, and Nazca was not the result of massive immigration, and that local people did not die out when they were invaded. In contrast, they added, people living in the cosmopolitan urban centers of the Tiwanaku and Inca cultures came from varied genetic backgrounds. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8953-200813-iran-parthian-tombs,Iron Age,\"2,000-Year-Old Burials Uncovered in Iran.

The analysis suggests that during the Bronze Age, the Mongolian diet was based on milk and meat and supplemented with local plants. From about the third century B.C. to the late first century A.D., during the Xiongnu Empire, some people continued to eat the Bronze Age diet, while those living in political centers began to eat more millet-based foods. Grain consumption and thus the practice of agriculture appears to have continued to increase into the period of the Mongolian Empire of the Khans. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNamely, instead of roving hoards, these empires were supported by pastoralists and farmers practicing different subsistence strategies that provided strength in diversity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained Shevan Wilkin of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8500-200303-ireland-neolithic-bru-na-boinne,Neolithic,\"Possible Neolithic Features Spotted in Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s River Boyne.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by UChicago Medicine , a new study suggests that Sardinians experienced less genetic turnover than populations living in mainland Europe, where large-scale migration is thought to have occurred during the Bronze Age. An international team of scientists analyzed the genomes of 70 Sardinians whose remains were recovered from more than 20 archaeological sites spanning a period of about 6,000 years. The scientists then compared the Sardinian DNA to DNA collected from other ancient and modern peoples. The researchers determined that Neolithic Sardinians were closely related to their contemporaries in mainland Europe. Sardinian genetic ancestry remained stable through 900 B.C., at a time when populations in mainland Europe began to shift and mix as people from other regions moved across the continent. It had been previously thought that a new style of stone tower that appeared on Sardinia around 900 B.C. may have been constructed by Bronze Age arrivals. The study of Sardinian genomes did detect population movement on the island in later periods, however, such as the arrival of the Phoenicians from what is now Lebanon, and the Punics, from what is now Tunisia, as early as 500 B.C. During the Roman and medieval periods, the scientists also found evidence of migration to the island from Italy and Spain. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8487-200227-virginia-custis-square,Modern,\"Archaeologists Investigate 18th-Century Virginia Garden.

JENA, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cosmos Magazine reports that humans may not have been as severely impacted by the eruption of Mount Toba in Indonesia some 74,000 years ago as had been previously thought. Researchers had suggested the eruption triggered a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvolcanic winter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that cooled Earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface for a period of 1,000 years, resulting in the near-extinction of hominins. In this scenario, members of a small populuation of modern human survivors in Africa were thought to have migrated along the coast of the Indian Ocean and repopulated Asia some 60,000 years ago. But, according to J.N. Pal of the University of Allahabad, stone artifacts unearthed in northern India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Middle Son River Valley indicate the region has been continuously inhabited for the past 80,000 years. The artifacts are similar to tools found in Arabia that date to between 100,000 and 47,000 years ago, and 65,000-year-old tools uncovered in Australia. The tools could therefore be linked to the dispersal of early modern humans out of Africa, added Chris Clarkson of the University of Queensland. The researchers explained that the evidence for thriving modern human populations at the time of the eruption also supports fossil and genetic evidence for the modern human migration out of Africa and intermixing with other species of hominins more than 60,000 years ago. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8485-200226-mexico-maya-sacbe,Pre-Columbian,\"Lidar Study Reveals Towns Along Sacred Maya Road.

Two of the genomes, found in the remains of hunter-gatherers who lived in what is now Russia, are from strains of the pathogen that cause miscarriages in horses and sheep. The other six genomes, recovered from ancient farmers and pastoralists, include the progenitor of a rare strain of bacteria that can now be deadly to humans, but in the past would have caused a milder form of illness in both humans and animals. The analysis also suggests that early farmers picked up Salmonella enterica from an unknown animal host, rather than from domesticated pigs some 4,000 years ago, as had been previously thought. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8482-200225-turkey-stele-luwian,Iron Age,\"Inscribed Stone in Turkey Offers Clue to Lost Iron Age City.

The plant remains included fruit pips, nut shells, tuber peelings, and fragments of palm stem thought to have been discarded from cooked meals. Florin, Fairbairn, and Clarkson then partnered with Nango and Djandjomerr to identify the modern versions of these plants, such as canarium, pandanus nuts, and cheeky yam, and the multistage cooking techniques required to make them edible. The researchers note that adapting to this diet would have required the first Australians to develop new technologies, including axes with ground edges and grinding stones, which have also been uncovered at the Madjedbebe rock shelter. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8466-200219-roman-forum-romulus,Roman,\"Possible Shrine Dedicated to Romulus Found in Roman Forum.

The sites range in age from 3,800 to 6,300 years old. The analysis revealed that the cod and seal bones both contained high levels of cadmium, lead, and mercury, which can cause organ damage in humans when consumed. The metals are thought to have leached into the water supply as sea levels rose and covered previously dry land. Blankholm and his colleagues said, however, that it is unclear if eating contaminated sea creatures harmed the people who lived in these prehistoric Arctic communities, since they also ate fruit and meat from reindeer and rabbits, and may not have lived long enough to accumulate many pollutants from the otherwise beneficial, high-protein foods from the sea. The next phase of research will analyze human remains recovered from the archaeological sites. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8460-200214-egypt-prehistory-cemetery,Egyptian,\"Prehistoric Clay Coffin Burials Uncovered in Northern Egypt.

In the 1940s, archaeologists discovered a stone ax underneath the volcanic rocks at the Tower Hill volcano, indicating that people lived in the region before the eruptions occurred. Matchan explained that the structure of the volcanoes suggests they grew their peaks within a period spanning just days to months. The researchers think an ancient story told by the Aboriginal Gunditjmara people about four giant beings, one of whom transformed into the Budj Bim volcano, might reference this volcanic activity and could reflect an oral tradition that has lasted for tens of thousands of years. Previous analysis of hair samples indicate that many Australian populations have occupied the same regions for nearly 50,000 years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs with all First Nations around the world, our stories, heritage, identity and survival are connected to our traditional homelands and waters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Damein Bell of Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8458-200213-colorado-petroglyphs-mapped,Native American,\"Colorado Petroglyphs Mapped With High-Tech Tools.

The first temple on the site has been tentatively dated to the tenth century B.C., while the monumental temple complex built on top of it has been dated to the late tenth century to early ninth century B.C. Kisilevitz said the temple complex at Motza conformed to religious conventions in the Kingdom of Judah at the time, but according to biblical texts, King Hezekiah and King Josiah restricted worship to the structure known as Jerusalem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s First Temple. The presence of the temple complex in Motza, she added, therefore suggests that other temples continued to operate outside of Jerusalem. Motza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s local leaders may have built the temple complex to increase their control over the region and bolster the success of the growing grain distribution business, she explained. Cultic artifacts including human-shaped and horse figurines, a cult stand decorated with lions or sphinxes, a stone altar, a stone offering table, and a pit filled with ash and bones have been uncovered at the site. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8448-200212-england-cremated-bone,Iron Age,\"Iron Age Bone Fragments Unearthed in Northeast England.

Although the game became popular among Egyptians some 5,000 years ago as a purely entertaining pastime, tomb art from about 700 years later shows deceased individuals playing senet against living relatives. By the early New Kingdom, symbols on the game board had changed. Egyptian texts mention that the game had taken on religious significance, reflecting a soul\\'s journey to the afterlife through Duat, the realm of the dead. Maastricht University archaeologist Walter Crist said the Rosicrucian board, which he has tentatively dated to the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca. 1550\\xe2\\x80\\x931295 B.C.), appears to be an early example of the redesigned game. One of its squares, which in earlier versions of the game was marked with an X, features the hieroglyph for water, believed by scholars to represent a body of water the soul encountered on its way through Duat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may be one of the first times that this aspect of the journey through the afterlife is visually rendered on the board,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Crist. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8413-200210-england-iron-age-hoard,Iron Age,\"Iron Age Gold Coin Hoard Declared Treasure.

Finch noted that, while encasing insect prey in mud, wasps often collect fragments of charcoal from the ground that can be radiocarbon dated. The wasps then affix the mud structures onto rock faces. Traces of this mud has been found under rock art, which provides its maximum possible age, while mud found on top of the rock art gives its minimum age, Finch explained. By collecting dates from artwork all over the region, he estimates the oldest images date back about 12,000 years, rather than 16,000 years ago, as previously thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll this is important because we can now begin to match the rock art with other types of information we are getting in the Kimberley, such as the stone tools that are uncovered by archaeologists and what we understand was happening with the climate and sea levels,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Finch said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8406-200206-mexico-paleoindian-skulls,Paleolithic,\"Newly Recovered Paleoindian Bones Examined.

In addition, their teeth are worn, without cavities, suggesting that their diet included hard foods.

Craig explained that the pots at each location had been manufactured in different ways between 16,000 and 12,000 years ago, and were likely invented independently by different groups. For example, pots recovered along the lower Amur likely held salmon and freshwater fish, while pots from the middle Amur held traces of fats from ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep, or goats. Craig and his team suggest that individual hunter-gatherer communities living in Northeast Asia, when faced with harsh Ice Age conditions, invented pottery so that they could cook their food and thus extract more nutrition from it, boosting their chances of survival. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8403-200204-japan-written-language,East Asia,\"When Did Written Language Reach Japan?.

This type of stone is not found in the jungle valley, however, and is thought to have been transported to the site and engraved with abstract, ornate images some 2,000 years ago. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat itself was a tremendous effort, a communal effort definitely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Fernandez-Davila said. Among the images are two fangs believed to be associated with a deity known to scholars as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeline feathered figure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which has been found at other 2,000-year-old archaeological sites in Peru. The researchers created the scan because they are concerned that the images on the stone could soon be lost to erosion. The presence of the monolith, Fernandez-Davila explained, suggests that the jungle valley where it is located was probably an important sacred space. He plans to return to the site for additional investigations. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8390-200129-lebanon-prehistoric-camp,Neolithic,\"New Dates Obtained for Prehistoric Hunting Camp in Lebanon.

Kolobova and Roberts said the presence of Micoquian blades in Chagyrskaya Cave suggests that Neanderthals migrated to Siberia from Eastern Europe, but, they add, such tools have not been found in Siberia\\'s Denisova Cave, where Neanderthal remains have also been recovered. Did more than one wave of Neanderthals migrate to Siberia? Genetic studies have indicated that the Neanderthals arrived in Siberia in at least two waves, since the later Neanderthal occupants of Denisova Cave were more closely related to European Neanderthals than they were to earlier Neanderthals who lived in the same cave. Roberts said Micoquian blades could also help researchers track Neanderthal migration. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just yet another indication that Neanderthals were just as creative, just as industrious, just as explorative in their nature as modern humans were,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8381-200127-india-assam-sculpture,South&Southeast Asia,\"Well-Preserved Statue Uncovered in Northeastern India.

LOUIS, MISSOURI\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by Washington University in St. Louis , a study of the wear and tear caused by food particles on tooth enamel suggests human ancestors may have eaten more hard plant foods than previously thought. Biological anthropologist Adam van Casteren explained that early hominins such as Australopiths had very large teeth and jaws, and probably also had huge chewing muscles that would have allowed them to crush nuts, seeds, tubers, and woody plant material. Scientists predicted such a diet would leave microscopic pits on fossilized hominin teeth, but most known specimens do not show this kind of wear and tear. So, Van Casteren and his colleagues dragged tiny pieces of seed shells across a Bornean orangutan molar, and observed the wear and tear they caused. The researchers found that the seed fragments did not leave behind any pits, scratches, or fractures in the orangutan molar, even though the seed particles began to break down as if they had been chewed. Van Casteren and his colleagues suggest the study will help researchers figure out what our earliest ancestors actually ate. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8365-200120-england-chester-wall,Roman,\"Section of Roman Wall Collapses in Chester, England.

Animal teeth found alongside the tools were dated to between 90,000 and 100,000 years ago, when Neanderthals are thought to have been the only hominins living in Western Europe. The tools, which are thought to have been used as scrapers, were made from the shell of a clam known as Callista chione, which lives in coastal waters at least three feet deep. Paola Villa of the University of Colorado Boulder said microscopic evaluation revealed that almost a quarter of the shell tools did not show signs of the wear and tear usually seen on shells collected on the seashore after being tossed in the waves. Rather, these shells were smooth, as if they had been harvested while still holding a live clam. It is not clear if the clams were eaten, however.

When Christopher Columbus arrived in the Bahamas in 1492, he recorded conflicts between the indigenous Arawak and Caribs, whom he described as marauding cannibals. But researchers lacked evidence showing that the Caribs had actually migrated so far north, and therefore doubted the accuracy of the explorer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account. The new test results and archaeological evidence suggest that Carib settlers from the Yucat\\xc3\\xa1n Peninsula reached the Caribbean around 5000 B.C., and they then traveled to Cuba and the northern Antilles, while Arawaks from Colombia and Venezuela arrived in Puerto Rico between 800 and 200 B.C. The study also indicates that Caribs from the northwest Amazon were the first to arrive in the Bahamas and the island of Hispaniola. Keegan said this migration pattern fits with the spread of a unique pottery type as well. He and Ross now think Columbus may have actually encountered the Caribs, but they said that there is still no real evidence that the Caribs practiced cannibalism. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8352-200114-olduvai-stone-tools,Pre-Human,\"Study Reveals Material Selection in Early Stone Age Tool Design.

Key said the study suggests that Early Stone Age toolmakers considered edge sharpness, cutting force, durability, and availability when choosing between different types of stone. For example, quartzite, Key explained, produced the sharpest tools, but was the least durable, and so was often chosen for flake tools, which are thought to have been used for short-term cutting activities. Chert, which was more durable than quartzite, produced tools that were almost as sharp, and was chosen for tools used for long periods of time. Hominins thus optimized their tools for specific circumstances, Key said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8350-200113-japan-gifu-castle,East Asia,\"Sixteenth-Century Wall Unearthed at Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gifu Castle.

The new dates, obtained through uranium-lead dating and fission-track dating, indicate Homo erectus reached Southeast Asia between 1.3 million and 1.5 million years ago, or about 300,000 to 500,000 years later than previously suggested by argon-argon dating. Because archaeological evidence points to the emergence of Homo erectus in Africa, the extremely old dates for Homo erectus in Java had created controversy among scholars over where the hominin could have originated. The new dates could help to resolve these inconsistencies. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis might not sound like a huge difference, but those 200,000 to 500,000 years swings the balance back to an African center of evolution for Homo erectus and helps to tie in the morphological changes seen between the younger and older hominins at Sangiran to a major climatic shift that occurred around 1.2 million years ago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d commented geochronologist Kira Westaway of Macquarie University. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8343-200109-iron-age-brain,Iron Age,\"Scientists Examine Well-Preserved Iron Age Brain Tissue.

Made up of more than 80 percent water, brains usually decompose quickly due to the action of enzymes present in human tissues. Petzold and his colleagues found that the outer areas of the Heslington brain still had proteins in place that normally act like scaffolding and maintain brain structure. But, the proteins had folded together even more tightly after death, and had caused the Heslington brain to shrink and become more compact. The scientists also observed this process in another brain about three months after death. They suggest that some sort of acidic fluid may have come in contact with the remains and deactivated the enzymes usually responsible for decomposition. Further research into such brain protein folding and unfolding could be useful for the study of neurodegenerative diseases, Petzold added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8341-200108-australia-rock-art,Paleolithic,\"Rock Art Destroyed at Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Baloon Cave.

Earlier this year, a second lower molar with three roots was identified in a Denisovan mandible discovered on the Tibetan Plateau. Shara Bailey of New York University and her colleagues suggested that that unusual tooth may be evidence of a link between Denisovans and modern Asian populations, where as many as 40 percent of people have three-rooted molars, compared to just 3.5 percent of non-Asians. The new CENIEH-led study points out that it is the first molar, and not the second, where a three-rooted tooth is more likely to be found in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Asian populations. Martin\\xc3\\xb3n-Torres and her colleagues also note that the third root found in the first molars of modern Asian populations has a different size, shape, and position than the Denisovan third root in the second molar.

BOLOGNA, ITALY\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Live Science reports that archaeologists led by Max Victor David of the University of Bologna have excavated a 1,600-year-old temple in Ostia thought to have been dedicated to several deities. The temple may have been primarily dedicated to the Zoroastrian god Mithras, whose cult the Romans imported from the East. Mithras is said to have been an excellent archer and is usually associated with light and sun. Paintings of tridents and arrows were found in one of the temple\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rooms. An inscription in the mithraeum mentions Mithras and Kronos, Greek god of harvest and time, suggesting Kronos may also have been venerated at the site. An Egyptian ivory handle, usually associated with the goddess Isis, points to her worship as well. David said banquets, initiation ceremonies, and animal sacrifices associated with Mithraism would have taken place in the building, and the participants may have achieved an altered state of consciousness through the use of psychotropic plants. In the mithraeum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spelaeum , a room intended to resemble a cave, the researchers uncovered a floor made of pieces of multicolored marble, a bench, a ritual well, and a possible flower bed.

In addition to armor, weaponry, and gold jewelry, that burial notably included an agate sealstone depicting combat between two warriors in exquisitely crafted detail. Like the Griffin Warrior grave, one of the the newly reported tombs also contained a sealstone, this time featuring two lion-like creatures called genii standing on clawed feet. The researchers also unearthed thousands of flakes of gold leaf that once papered the tombs\\' walls, amber from the Baltic, imported carnelian, and a gold pendant with an engraved depiction of the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor dating to the 15th century B.C.

The collection of bones represents at least 20 people, including 14 men, one woman, adolescents, and an 18-month-old child who was decapitated and dismembered. Heat marks indicate the remains had been exposed to fire, perhaps to assist with the removal of skin and flesh from the bones. Different regions of the world have characteristic strontium isotope ratios in their soils, which are reflected in the ratios of strontium isotopes in a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tooth enamel. Because tooth enamel is formed during childhood, the process allows scientists to determine where an individual grew up. Strontium analysis of the teeth of 13 of these individuals indicates that some of them grew up at least 95 miles away, in what is now Guatemala. At least one adult and one infant were local residents of Uxul. Overall, eight of the individuals are thought to have been of high social status, since they had elaborate jade tool jewelry or engravings in their incisors. Seefeld and his colleagues suggest the treatment of the remains was a demonstration of power over prisoners of war. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8295-191216-child-sized-atlatls,Native American,\"Study Suggests Children Practiced Throwing Child-Sized Atlatls.

Located on the northern coast of Oregon, the site was created by Native Americans more than 1,000 years ago. Careful measurement of the atlatls, which were carved from whale bone with a grip at one end and a hook for a dart on the other, revealed that the largest was 166 percent bigger than the smallest, a size difference much larger than the variations found among adult-sized hands. Thus, the researchers suggest the smaller weapons were used by children to master the skill of dart throwing, which would have been critical to their survival. Previous tests conducted with smaller atlatls found the weapons to be highly effective, in that they could hurl a dart some 100 feet. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8294-191216-cyprus-roman-road,Roman,\"Roman Urban Planning Techniques Investigated in Cyprus.

The theater was constructed in 300 B.C. for dramatic performances and was eventually used by the Romans as an arena that could be flooded for water spectacles. In A.D. 365, the theater was destroyed by an earthquake. The recent investigations exposed the Roman road to the south of the theater. It was constructed with limestone pavers, ran east-west to the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s northeastern gate, measured nearly 28 feet wide, and was equipped with a drainage system. Wheel ruts in the road indicate it was used by vehicular as well as foot traffic. Barker and his team also found debris of the fourth-century earthquake on the road surface, and evidence that its stone blocks were reused in later periods. Some 100 feet to the south, evidence of a pathway covered in rubble was uncovered, along with building foundations and fragments of painted plaster. Barker said the position of the road and the pathway helped to confirm the size of city blocks in the region around the theater. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8289-191213-england-pocklington-shield,Iron Age,\"Restoration of Iron Age Shield Reveals Elaborate Decorations.

When depicted in paintings, the cones adorn the heads of prominent and powerful individuals, so some archaeologists have expected to find such cones in elite graves, and speculated that they may have been scented. In the 3,300-year-old graves at Amarna, however, one cone was discovered on the head of a woman who died in her 20s, while the other was found with the remains of a person of undetermined sex who died between the ages of 15 and 20. Their names and occupations are unknown, Stevens said. Examination of the cone remnants with portable infrared and X-ray machines showed that they were made of wax and were hollow, but the researchers have found no trace of scented resins or perfumes, which may have evaporated, in the artifacts so far. Stevens suggests the headgear may have been intended to provide assistance in the afterlife. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8283-191211-chichen-itza-table,Pre-Columbian,\"Carved Limestone Slab Uncovered in Chichen Itza.

Such beads date back to more than 40,000 years ago and have been unearthed throughout Africa. Miller and Sawchuk measured 1,200 beads recovered from 30 archaeological sites spanning a 10,000 year period in southern and eastern Africa and compared the data with other archaeological evidence of cultural change. The researchers confirmed that larger beads appeared in southern Africa some 2,000 years ago, when people began to herd sheep and goats, but did not replace existing bead styles. The larger bead size may have been introduced by the people who brought domesticated animals to the region, they explained. In eastern Africa, however, bead styles did not change at the time herding was introduced, although beads made by foragers in eastern Africa were similarly sized to the larger beads made by herders in southern Africa. The researchers conclude that peoples from southern and eastern Africa may have had contact with each other as herding spread, but the experience did not extinguish local traditions. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8276-191209-pompeii-groma-mosaic,Roman,\"Pompeii Mosaic May Depict Surveyors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Tool.

Roman survey technicians, known as gromatici , employed a cross-shaped instrument called a groma . A cord hanging from each of the perpendicular arms of the cross ended with a weight or plumb bob that could be used to create plumb lines. Thus, the tool allowed surveyors to establish true vertical and horizontal lines when planning towns and aqueducts. One groma has been uncovered at Pompeii, but their use has only been known from texts dating to the medieval period. Osanna and his colleagues explained that one of the mosaic images in the House of Orion resembles those seen in a medieval text. It consists of a square inscribed in a circle, which is cut by two perpendicular lines. One of the lines aligns with the longitudinal axis of the structure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s atrium. A second image, made up of a circle inscribed with a cross, appears to depict a groma.

Staudigel suggests that pottery technology, which would have been necessary for boiling the clams in water, may not have been in widespread use. Some of the clams had been exposed to lower levels of heat, he added. They may have been placed on top of clams that had been placed directly over cooking fires. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8274-191209-england-roman-egg,Roman,\"Roman-Era Eggs and Bread Basket Recovered from Watery Pit.

EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a report in The Guardian , a population study conducted by Krist Vaesen of Eindhoven University of Technology and his colleagues suggests the arrival of modern humans in Europe may not have triggered the demise of Neanderthals some 40,000 years ago. When modern humans arrived in Europe some 60,000 years ago, the Neanderthal population is thought to have numbered between 10,000 and 70,000 individuals. Vaesen said the models explored what might have happened to Neanderthal populations over a period of 10,000 years, factoring in the possible impact of inbreeding; natural fluctuations in birth rates, deaths, and sex ratios; and so-called Allee effects, which hamper the growth of small populations through limited mate choice and a lack of hunters and caregivers. Inbreeding, which harms the fitness of the population, may have been the sole cause of Neanderthal extinction, Vaesen explained, although in one scenario explored by the researchers, modern humans could have contributed to Neanderthal extinction by simply being present in the environment and isolating different Neanderthal groups. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has nothing to do with competition or superiority, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a fragmentation of the habitat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8272-191206-roman-lead-levels,Roman,\"Study Suggests Roman Britons Suffered from Toxic Lead Levels.

The level of lead in the bones from Londinium was high enough to have affected the health of urban Romans, Scott explained, and may have even impacted their birth rates through reduced sperm levels, stillbirths, and premature births. Scott suggests Romans were exposed to lead through lead plumbing, though it was not widely used in Roman London, lead drinking vessels, and even through the use of lead acetate as a food sweetener. Critics of the study note that bone can absorb lead and other metals from soil, making it hard to rule out contamination after death. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6335-180208-egypt-tel-edfu,Egyptian,\"4,500-Year-Old Buildings Unearthed in Upper Egypt.

One of the structures still had its rare and expensive wooden door, and the outer fa\\xc3\\xa7ade of the larger one was designed with an unusual slope. The buildings were part of a larger complex of open courtyards, workshops, and storage areas where more than 200 broken clay seals, which were used to mark boxes, containers, and letters, were found. The researchers think areas in the structures might have been used for making beer and bread, and for smelting copper. The buildings may have also housed officials who came from the capital in Memphis to inspect the mining of metals and gems in the surrounding desert.

The wood was likely to have been transported down the Sa\\xc3\\xb4ne and Rh\\xc3\\xb4ne rivers to the Mediterranean Sea, and then up the Tiber River to Rome, where the demand for high-quality wood is likely to have depleted local trees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe timber found in other important sites\\xe2\\x80\\x94Pompeii, Herculaneum\\xe2\\x80\\x94may be of foreign origin,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bernabei added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8226-191205-china-neolithic-silk,Neolithic,\"Silk Fabrics Detected in Neolithic Burial in Central China. ZHENGZHOU, CHINA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Xinhua reports that researchers led by Zhao Feng of the China National Silk Museum developed a technique called enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the presence of silk in carbonized residue in a burial at the Neolithic Wanggou site in central China. The fabric is thought to have been used to wrap the body before it was placed in a silkworm pupa-shaped coffin for burial. Zhao thinks the shape of the coffin may have been intended to evoke rebirth after death in the same manner that a silk moth breaks through its cocoon. Gu Wanfa of the Zhengzhou Municipal Research Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology explained that the fabrics at Wanggou indicate that silk production was well developed in China between 5,300 and 5,500 years ago. Examination of the sample with an electron microscope revealed fine yarns woven with four-warp twisted rods, and the yarns had been dyed before they were woven into fabric, which was then \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccooked\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to prevent the dye from fading, Gu added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8222-191204-impact-justinian-plague,Roman,\"New Thoughts on the Impact of the Plague of Justinian.

The fragments are part of a collection of some 7,500 tablets that were excavated from the ancient Mesopotamian city of Ur by a team of researchers from the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum between 1922 and 1934, under the direction of Sir Charles Leonard Woolley, who is recognized as one of the first archaeologists to excavate methodically and keep meticulous records. The tablets have since been held at the Penn Museum under a loan agreement with the government of Iraq. So far, more than 3,000 of the tablets have been repatriated. Penn Museum research associate William B.

The remains of at least several million Threskiornis aethiopicus , mummified between 600 B.C. and A.D. 250, have been recovered from ancient temples dedicated to Thoth, the ibis-headed god of wisdom. Ibis mummies are thought to have been available for purchase at the temples, where they were put on display as offerings, and then eventually moved into tunnels and storage rooms beneath the temples. The 40 DNA samples in the study were collected from five such catacombs. Wasef and her team members were able to recover mitochondrial genomes from 14 of them, and found that none of these birds were closely related to each other through the maternal line, as they would have been if they had been bred in captivity for generations.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK\\xe2\\x80\\x94The latest round in an ongoing debate over the age and authorship of ancient cave paintings in Spain now revolves around the reliability of a dating technique called U-Th, according to a report in Science News . U-Th, sometimes known as the U-series method, allows researchers to establish the minimum age of cave paintings by dating mineral deposits that have formed on top of them. These deposits contain trace amounts of uranium, which decays to thorium at a steady rate, so the age of the designs can be calculated from the ratio of the two elements. In 2018, a team led by geochronologist Dirk Hoffmann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, published a minimum date of more than 64,000 years ago for cave paintings at three separate sites in Spain, arguing that, as modern humans are not believed to have entered the region until about 40,000 years ago, the designs must have been made by Neanderthals. The assertion immediately made waves among scholars of cave art. Criticisms leveled at the paper have included questions over the cognitive capacity of Neanderthals to have produced the artwork, and, now, concerns that water running across cave surfaces could have reduced uranium levels in the mineral deposits, making it appear that the uranium had been decaying longer than it actually has. This would mean the Spanish cave art could be tens of thousands of years more recent, and well within the timeframe of modern humans. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8146-191030-akkadian-dust-storms-collapse,Bronze Age,\"Sandstorms May Have Triggered Akkadian Empire\\'s Fall.

TSUKUBA, JAPAN\\xe2\\x80\\x94Scientists led by Yasuyuki Mitsuma of the University of Tsukuba have found evidence of solar magnetic storms that took place sometime between 679 and 655 B.C. in radioisotope data collected from ancient trees and records kept on cuneiform tablets by ancient Assyrian astronomers. Some 2,700 years ago, astronomers in Babylon and Nineveh documented an unusual red glow in the sky on three separate cuneiform tablets, he explained. Mitsuma and his colleagues suggest this phenomenon may have been what are now known as stable auroral red arcs, which consist of light emitted by electrons in atmospheric oxygen atoms excited by intense magnetic fields. Tree ring data also registered a rapid rise in radioactive carbon-14 in the environment, which is associated with increased solar activity, at this time. Mitsuma said the information pushes the history of known solar activity back a century, and could help scientists predict future magnetic storms. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8123-191021-abu-dhabi-pearl,Neolithic,\"World\\'s Oldest Pearl Found Near Abu Dhabi.

Research team members Alissa Mittnik of Harvard Medical School and Philipp Stockhammer of Ludwig Maximilian University and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History explained that some of the high-ranking male individuals in the sample carried a variant of the Y chromosome, which is passed from fathers to sons, associated with the Neolithic Bell Beaker culture. The Y chromosome variant carried by these men is still found in Europe today. Men buried without grave goods in the family cemeteries carried a different variant of the Y chromosome. Women who had been buried with elaborate grave goods carried DNA unrelated to others buried in the cemetery.

This is the first large building from the Fujiwarakyo era to be found away from the center of the ancient capital. Hitoshi Hayashibe of the National Museum of Japanese History thinks that the luxurious home suggests the nobility of Fujiwarakyo were not required to live near the imperial palace, as was required by Empress Genmei, who completed the move of the imperial capital from Fujiwarakyo to Heijokyo in A.D. 710.

The text describes the tomb occupant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming-of-age party as a young man, which featured a banquet for 6,840 people and a gladiator show with more than 400 fighters. Osanna said the guests would have only been adult men who possessed political rights, or about 27 to 30 percent of the population, putting the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total at about 30,000 people around A.D. 59. The inscription also relates how the man sold wheat at discounted prices to Pompeii citizens and distributed free bread during a four-year famine. Osanna thinks this gesture may have been depicted in a now famous Pompeii mosaic showing bread distribution to two men and a child. This citizen was also remembered for successfully speaking to Emperor Nero on behalf of Pompeians who were ejected from the city after a riot during a gladiator show. Based upon the contents of other inscriptions in the city, Osanna thinks the tomb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s occupant may have been Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius, but the area where a name had been carved in the tomb was destroyed by looters in the nineteenth century. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8044-191002-zominthos-palace-throne,Bronze Age,\"Possible Minoan Throne Room Unearthed in Crete.

Denisovans are thought to have first occupied the cave some 287,000 years ago, while Neanderthals are thought to have arrived 140,000 years ago. However, the test results suggest hominins only visited the cave sporadically, if at all. Archaeologist Mike Morley of Flinders University said the amount of fossilized hyena and wolf droppings in the cave suggest non-human carnivores were the cave\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary inhabitants. In addition, the limited evidence for the use of fire in the cave could mean that hominin bones might have been carried into the cave by scavenging hyenas. The study also revealed that the climate in the region changed from a cold and arid open steppe during glacial periods to warmer, wetter forested steppe during interglacial periods. Morley said Neanderthals and Denisovans were probably both well adapted to living in cold weather. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8040-190930-rome-citizenship-veteran,Roman,\"1,700-Year-Old Bronze Document Found in Roman Fortress.

Eustachian tubes are cartilaginous structures connecting the middle ear to the upper throat and the back of the nasal cavity. The team of physical anthropologists and head and neck anatomists found that Neanderthal Eustachian tubes had a flat angle resembling the Eustachian tubes of modern human infants. Middle ear infections are common among young children today because this flat angle is prone to trapping bacteria in the tube. But by the age of five, the tubes lengthen and the angle becomes more acute, allowing the ear to drain. It appears, however, that the lifelong flat angle of Neanderthal Eustachian tubes left the hominins susceptible to ear infections and complications such as respiratory infections, hearing loss, pneumonia, and chronic health problems that could have made it difficult to compete for survival. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8034-190926-england-roman-fort,Roman,\"Roman Fort Found in Southwest England.

The Tripolye culture, also known as the Cucuteni-Tripyllia culture, occupied the area from the Carpathian Mountains to the Dnieper River from about 4100 to 3600 B.C. The rectangular building, made of clay-covered split wood and logs, had a roofed-off section with a fireplace, a walled courtyard, and was one of 3,000 individual homes arranged in concentric rings at Maidanetske, although the researchers, led by Robert Hofmann of Christian-Albrechts University, are not sure how many of the structures existed at the same time. Other prehistoric megastructures measuring up to 18,000 square feet have been found in Eastern Europe through geophysical surveys, but without excavation, researchers did not know how such structures were used.

It had been previously thought that childbirth became more difficult over the course of evolution as hominins transitioned to upright walking. Today, a modern human fetus often requires assistance to rotate its large head through a narrow birth canal over a long period of labor, while chimpanzees and other non-human primates are able to deliver their infants alone and over a period of several hours. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a tendency to think about the evolution of human birth as a transition from an \\xe2\\x80\\x98easy,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ape-like birth to a \\xe2\\x80\\x98difficult,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 modern birth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Laudicina explained.

Michael Eisenberg of the University of Haifa said images of loaves of bread, fish, fruit, birds, and baskets in the mosaic could refer to two miracles described in the Christian New Testament, in which Jesus multiplied a few loaves and fishes to feed thousands of people, and his disciples collected leftovers. Although the purported location of the miracles is unclear, he added, the church may have been built in Hippos to mark the site where the miracles were believed to have occurred.

Such gestures include stroking the mouth to request food and raising arms to request grooming, Graham explained. The researchers asked human experiment participants to watch video clips of ten signs commonly used by chimpanzees and bonobos, and asked them to choose a correct meaning for each sign from four options. Some gestures, such as stroking of the mouth to request food, were identified correctly by the study participants more than 80 percent of the time. They correctly identified other signals about 52 percent of the time, Graham said. An earlier study conducted by University of St. Andrews psychologists identified gestures used by great apes in human children between the ages of one and two, and found that almost 90 percent of the 52 gestures used by the human children were shared with chimpanzees.

It had been previously thought that the tin used in bronze production in the Levant in the second millennium B.C. was imported from central Asia, since very little raw tin exists in the region. Comparison of the composition of the various samples revealed, however, that tin ingots found at three sites off the coast of Haifa, Israel, are likely to have been mined in southwest England, in what are now the areas of Cornwall and Devon. Tin from mines in Anatolia, central Asia, and Egypt was ruled out as a source for these samples because it was formed either much earlier or later. The researchers suggest that amber, glass, and copper were probably also traded along complex routes connecting Europe and the eastern Mediterranean much earlier than had been believed. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8009-190916-china-painted-tomb,East Asia,\"1,000-Year-Old Painted Tomb Uncovered in China.

Cleveland Museum of Natural History paleoanthropologist\\xc2\\xa0Yohannes Haile-Selassie says the skull belongs to the human ancestor Australopithecus anamensis , thought to have lived as early as 4.2 million years ago and known mainly by its jaws and teeth. Named MRD after Miro Dora, the site where it was found, this individual probably had a brain about the size of that of a chimpanzee, jutting cheekbones, elongated canine teeth, and oval-shaped earholes. It had been previously thought that Australopithecus anamensis , which was identified in 1995, gave rise to Australopithecus afarensis , made famous by the discovery of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLucy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 1974. The new discovery suggests, however, that the two species coexisted for a period of about 100,000 years. Australopithecus afarensis is also known for its bigger brain and flatter face, Haile-Selassie explained, calling into question the ancestry of later hominins who also had projecting cheekbones and oval-shaped earholes that resembled those of Australopithecus anamensis . \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7973-190829-orkney-swandro-pendant,Iron Age,\"Seal-Tooth Pendant Uncovered at Iron Age Village in Scotland.

Pierattini attempted to move similarly grooved stone blocks with a simple lifting machine, and found that the grooves could have allowed ancient builders to lift blocks weighing between about 400 and 900 pounds, and position them with the assistance of metal levers.

Botanists Susanne Renner of the University of Munich and Guillaume Chomicki of the University of Oxford analyzed a tiny piece of one of the ancient watermelon leaves that were discovered in an Egyptian tomb and sent to botanist Joseph Hooker in London in the late nineteenth century. Fortunately, the partial genome sequence the researchers obtained from the artifact contained genes related to color and taste. This melon plant did not produce the bitter cucurbitacins found in Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wild, round watermelons. It also lacked a functioning gene for transforming the red pigment lycopene into another substance, which means the plant produced fruit with red flesh.

It had been previously suggested that such yellow glass could have been formed by the heat and pressure created by an asteroid that exploded near the Earth, in an event known as an airburst. But Cavosie and his colleagues detected evidence that the zircon in the glass samples had transformed from reidite, a mineral only formed under pressure so intense it must have been triggered by an actual meteor impact.

Made up of 85 characters based on the syllables of the Cherokee language, the syllabary used in the inscriptions was invented in the early nineteenth century by Sequoyah, a Cherokee silversmith. It was officially adopted by the Cherokee Nation in 1825, and was widely used to communicate in daily life and in print. Jan Simek of the University of Tennessee, along with scholars from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees, and the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, as well as additional colleagues worked together to understand the cave\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inscriptions.

Moreover, the presence of chromium on a weapon did not correlate with how well it was preserved.

Martin\\xc3\\xb3n-Torres and his colleagues think chromium may have been applied to the wooden parts of weapons, and that any chromium that they detected on the metal parts of weapons was probably contamination from treated wood that had rotten away.

Biological anthropologist Christina Stantis of Bournemouth University and her colleagues analyzed strontium isotopes in the teeth of 71 individuals whose remains were unearthed at Tell el-Dab\\xe2\\x80\\x99a, the site of the Hyksos capital in the Nile Delta. About half of the remains in the sample dated to hundreds of years before Hyksos rule, while the rest dated to the period of the Hyksos dynasty. The strontium levels indicate that most of the women buried in elite graves shortly before the Hyksos came to power grew up eating plants and animals raised outside the Nile Valley. By contrast, all but a few of the elite males from this time period were found to have grown up locally. Stantis suggests the nonlocal women were Hyksos women who may have married into Egyptian royal families after moving to the Nile Delta. The study also suggests that about half of the men and women buried in the cemetery during the period of Hyksos rule came to Tell el-Dab\\xe2\\x80\\x99a from elsewhere.

Archaeologist Leonardo Lopez Lujan of Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s National Institute of Anthropology and History said that a wooden disc bearing Huitzilopochtli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emblem was found on the jaguar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back. An atlatl was also placed in the box, which was covered with shells, a red starfish from the Pacific Ocean, and coral, perhaps to represent the sun\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overnight journey through the watery underworld. The boy also wore a wooden disc bearing Huitzilopochtli\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emblem, and a bead necklace made of jade from Central America. Wings made of hawk bones were attached to his shoulders. The cremated remains of three Aztec kings are thought to have been buried near the circular platform between 1469 and 1502 along with luxurious offerings, according to accounts written after the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1521. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7490-190321-china-imperial-gate,East Asia,\"Imperial Palace Gate Uncovered in Central China.

AARHUS, DENMARK\\xe2\\x80\\x94Isotope geochemist Rasmus Andreasen of Aarhus University and his colleagues suggest that the presence of modern, strontium-rich agricultural lime in the landscape may have skewed earlier interpretations of the Egtved Girl and Skrydstrup Woman, according to a Live Science report. Previous analysis of isotopes obtained from the Bronze Age remains indicated that the Egtved Girl may have grown up in southern Germany, and traveled between Denmark and another location in the last years of her life, before she died in Denmark. Skrydstrup Woman was also thought to have arrived in Denmark as a teenager. But Andreasen grew concerned that the maps of strontium distributions on which these conclusions were based did not reflect conditions prior to the introduction of modern farming techniques. After adjusting for the presence of agricultural lime, Andreasen and his team members say the data suggests the women may have actually spent their lives within about six miles of where they were buried. The researchers behind the original studies are unconvinced, however. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOverall, there is nothing in the study from Aarhus which changes our interpretation: That the two women from the Bronze Age came from afar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Karin Frei, a professor of archaeometry at the National Museum of Denmark, and Robert Frei, a professor of geology and geochemistry at the University of Copenhagen. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7474-190314-ireland-bog-butter,Bronze Age,\"New Dates for Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \"\"Bog Butters\"\".

They dated 32 bog butters held at the National Museum of Ireland, and analyzed samples of the fats to determine whether they were actually milk fats or fats from animal carcasses. The results of the tests indicate that the waxy substances are indeed degraded butter, and push back the origin of the practice of storing butter in bogs by some 1,500 years. In fact, five of the samples date to the Bronze Age. The oldest sample, which dates to around 1700 B.C., is thought to have been wrapped in bark. Smyth said the dairy products may have simply been stored in the cool, low-oxygen, high-acid environment of bogs in order to preserve them for future consumption, or they may have been offerings, just as gold, axes, and other bladed weapons were deposited in bogs during the Bronze Age. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7471-190314-israel-negev-elusa,Near East,\"Inscription Identifies Ancient City in Negev Desert.

Geoscientist Dan Penny of the University of Sydney and his colleagues found that evidence of burning, forest disturbances, and soil erosion in the form of traces of plants, pollen, and minerals in the sediment cores decreased throughout the fourteenth century. At the same time, pollen from floating vegetation in the moat increased, indicating that the moat was not being maintained as it once had been.

Archaeological evidence suggests the population of Cahokia grew between A.D. 600 and 1100, was in decline by 1200, and that the city had been abandoned by 1400. The team, which also included AJ White of California State University, suggests that when the ancient city\\'s population was higher, more human waste would be expected to have washed into Horseshoe Lake, leaving behind higher levels of stanols. Schroeder said the concentration of fecal stanols in the different layers of the sediment cores did rise and fall over time in accord with previous population estimates. The researchers tied their population study to an earlier one that found evidence of significant Mississippi River flooding around A.D. 1150, and they looked for additional evidence of changing climate conditions in the form of different levels of oxygen isotopes in the sediment cores. They found a likely drop in summer rainfall, which was necessary for farming, at about the time Cahokia began to decline. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7432-190225-peru-inca-baths,Pre-Columbian,\"Inca Ritual Baths Studied in Peru.

This is based upon his study of stone artifacts from the site of the Uruujitokyu ruins in Itoshima, the Nakabaru ruins in Karatsu, and the Higashi Oda Mine ruins in Chikuzen. It had been previously thought that writing emerged in Japan around the third century A.D., based upon the discovery of pottery decorated with written characters. Ink stones, which are generally thin, flat, fan-shaped, and polished on one side, are thought to have originated in China in the third century B.C. Ink stones dating to the first century have been previously unearthed in southwestern Japan, but they were believed to have been imported. Some of the possible ink stones recently identified by Yanagida had been broken before they were completed.

The Caucasus region stretches from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, and includes part or all of what is now Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, and Turkey. Wolfgang Haak of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History suggested that Bronze Age farmers living in the southern Caucasus likely spread north over the mountains, where they met nomads from the Eurasian steppe, some of whom were related to Yamnaya groups to the northwest. Other steppe-dwellers, such as the Steppe Maykop, had genes resembling those found in Paleolithic Siberians, ancient Native Americans, and modern North Asians, he said.

The faces of the man and woman, along with identifying hieroglyphics, were scratched out of the sculpture, so the researchers are trying to reconstruct the information. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the ancient Egyptians, being remembered after death was very important, so they would receive offerings in the netherworld,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Moeller explained. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBy erasing someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name, you are also taking away their identity and the good deeds they did during their lifetimes for which they will be remembered after death.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Other artifacts recovered from the shrine could offer clues to help solve the puzzle, Moeller said.

The tunnel leads to a set of stairs, and then a second tunnel, which ends in a rectangular room with rock-cut benches. An oval hearth in the wall opposite the entrance to the room is thought to have been used to heat large stones. Water would then have been poured over them to create steam. Koszkul and \\xc5\\xb9ra\\xc5\\x82ka suggest the excess water would have flowed into a hollow in the middle of the bath\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rock floor, and out of the structure through a drain channel in the tunnels.

Three of the men with the growths were buried together. The growths, known as external auditory exostoses, or surfers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ear, are thought to form as a reaction to long exposure to cold wind and water. And although Panama is a tropical country, water temperatures in the Gulf of Panama drop between January and April, when trade winds from the north blow warm surface water out into the Pacific Ocean, and colder water rises to the surface. Smith-Guzm\\xc3\\xa1n suggested the growths could indicate that early Panamanians spent a lot of time in deep waters to retrieve thorny oysters, giant conch, and pearl oysters, rather than the occurrence of fungal or bacterial infections, since the condition appeared mostly in males. If the growths had been caused by illness, they would have appeared in both men and women at about the same rate, she reasoned.

It had been previously thought that the city\\'s abandonment in the fifteenth century was the result of a war with a neighboring kingdom and, possibly, the rise of Buddhism over Hinduism, but Penny and his colleagues think climate-induced infrastructure collapse could be to blame for the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demise. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7036-181015-china-grand-lady,East Asia,\"Song Dynasty Tomb of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrand Lady\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Excavated in China.

HIGHLAND PARK, TEXAS\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cosmos Magazine reports that Jenna Battillo of Southwestern Methodist University says that consuming a fungus that grows on corn allowed the ancestral Puebloans to survive on a corn-based diet beginning around 400 B.C. and lasting for a period of about 800 years. Corn is thought to have comprised about 80 percent of the calories consumed by the people of the Basketmaker II culture, who also ate a small amount of wild plants, and occasionally some wild rabbit, but not enough to make up for the lack of essential nutrients in their staple crop. Yet, analysis of human remains from the period have not detected signs of pellagra, a potentially fatal disease that can be caused by the lack of vitamins and amino acids in a corn-based diet. Now considered a delicacy, corn fungus, or Ustilago maydis , alters the nutritional content of corn, increasing its protein levels and boosting the levels of most of the missing amino acids. Battillo suggests the ancient practice of boiling corn with limestone, and the small amount of food consumed from other sources, may have provided enough of the key missing amino acid to keep the ancestral Puebloans healthy. The levels of corn fungus spores in the human feces found at Turkey Pen Ruin, an ancestral Pueblo site in Utah, suggests the corn fungus may have been eaten intentionally, she added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6794-180717-japan-pottery-fishing,East Asia,\"Fishing May Have Driven Use of Pottery in Ancient Japan.

The 4,000-year-old samples taken from the farmers who lived at Vietnam\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Man Bac site suggest their ancestors were hunter-gatherers and rice farmers from southern China. A third wave of migration arrived in Myanmar some 3,000 years ago, in Vietnam about 2,000 years ago, and in Thailand within the last 1,000 years. Each of these movements are believed to be associated with different languages spoken today. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6610-180510-alaska-fish-trap,Native American,\"Alutiiq Fish Trap Spotted From the Air in Alaska.

PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Live Science report, Stephen Gluckman of the University of Pennsylvania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Perelman School of Medicine suggests that Saladin may have been killed by typhoid. Born in what is now Tikrit, Iraq, Saladin fought against the Egyptian Fatimid Caliphate, and eventually became commander of Syrian troops in Egypt. In 1187, his army conquered Jerusalem, which led to the Third Crusade, from 1189 to 1192. Saladin died in 1193, at the age of 55 or 56, after a two-week-long illness with fever. Gluckman analyzed historical documents that recorded the sultan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s symptoms, and ruled out plague or smallpox, which kill people quickly, and tuberculosis, because there was no mention of coughing or breathing problems. Malaria, Gluckman added, is likely to have caused chills, which were not listed in the records. However, Gluckman explained, typhoid is contracted through the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella typhi , and causes high fever, weakness, stomach pain, headache, and loss of appetite. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6591-180503-scroll-fragments-infrared,Near East,\"Texts Found on Small Dead Sea Scroll Fragments.

Using infrared imaging, Ableman discovered Hebrew letters and words on the fragments. He was able to determine that some of the scraps had fallen from the scrolls of Deuteronomy and Leviticus, two books from the Hebrew Bible, and from the Book of Jubilees, which was written during the same period. Of the many fragments in the collection, one is thought to be from an unknown third copy of the Temple Scroll; a piece of Psalm 147:1 from the Great Psalms Scroll which suggests the ancient version of the Psalm is slightly shorter than the modern one; and a fragment bearing letters written in paleo-Hebrew that could belong to an unknown manuscript. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6559-180420vietnam-imperial-citadel,South&Southeast Asia,\"Dragon Tiles Recovered in Vietnam.

Nimrod Marom of the University of Haifa and Tel Hai College, Guy Bar-Oz and Yotam Tepper of the University of Haifa, and Baruch Rosen of the Volcani Center compared the skull and skeleton measurements of pigeons from multiple 1,500-year-old dovecotes at the sites of Shivta and Saadon, and compared them with other collections of pigeon bones. They found the Negev birds were much smaller than those known to have been bred for their meat. And, the farmers placed their dovecotes in the middle of agricultural fields, usually about one-half mile away from their own homes, which also suggests the birds were not consumed. The scientists estimate the 1,200 to 1,600 birds living in one of the dovecotes could have produced as much as 12 to 15 tons of guano per year that could be used to nourish grapes, olives, and other crops. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6461-180322-new-jersey-native-american,Native American,\"Prehistoric Native American Sites Excavated in New Jersey.

BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 BBC News reports that an excavation in southeast England under the direction of archaeologist Rachel Wood, ahead of the construction of a high-speed railway line, has uncovered evidence of occupation spanning a 4,000-year period. The finds include traces of a Neolithic wooden henge whose features are aligned with the winter solstice, and the 2,000-year-old remains of a man who was buried face down with his hands bound behind his back. Wood thinks he may have been murdered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe hope our osteologists will be able to shed more light on this potentially gruesome death,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. In addition to the Iron Age skeleton, the project has uncovered a gold coin dated to about 100 B.C., and a Roman-era lead coffin that also contained a skeleton. This coffin probably had a wooden outer layer, Wood added. \",A,Neolithic,Iron Age,0,7,\"[0, 7]\",[7 0]\\n6,https://www.archaeology.org/news/8959-200817-tuberculosis-genome-analyzed,\"Genome Study Yields New Date for Arrival of TB in Europe.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by New York University , researchers Michael D. Purugganan, Rafal M. Gutaker, and their colleagues combined information about the genomes of more than 1,400 varieties of rice with geographical, archaeological, and historical climate data to trace the spread of rice farming across northern and southern Asia. It had been previously thought that rice diversity was based upon the amount of available water, but the study suggests that temperature may have been the key factor. The researchers determined that the japonica subspecies of Asian rice, which was first cultivated in China some 9,000 years ago, was mainly farmed in China for some 4,000 years, until a global cooling event some 4,200 years ago. At that point, japonica rice split into temperate and tropical varieties. The temperate varieties were grown in northern China, Korea, and Japan, while the tropical varieties spread to Southeast Asia. The researchers explained that this change in varieties of rice some 4,200 years ago is reflected in the archaeological record. The genetic analysis and archaeological record also indicate that tropical japonica rice reached islands in Southeast Asia some 2,500 years ago through trade networks. The indica subspecies of rice, on the other hand, originated in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lower Ganges Valley some 4,000 years ago, and was probably first transported to China some 2,000 years ago.\\xc2\\xa0\",A,East Asia,South&Southeast Asia,3,4,\"[3, 4]\",[10  4]\\n10,https://www.archaeology.org/news/8787-200610-ireland-long-boat,\"Possible Ancient Longboat Recovered in Ireland.

The vessel may have been built as early as the Neolithic period or as late as the Middle Ages. There is one crann\\xc3\\xb3g, or artificial island, in the lake, which may have been connected to a river thousands of years ago. The boy and his family contacted the Underwater Archaeology Unit of Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht after removing the 17- and one-half-foot piece of wood from the water.

KOSTOLAC, SERBIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ars Technica reports that coal miners in eastern Serbia discovered three boats in what may have been a branch of the Danube River some 1,300 years ago. The site where the vessels were uncovered is near the ancient Roman city of Viminacium, which fell to invaders around A.D. 600. Archaeologist Miomir Korac of the Viminacium Science Project said that the largest of the three boats, which was seriously damaged by the miners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 equipment, had a flat bottom, a single deck, at least six pairs of oars, fittings for a triangular sail, and measured about 49 feet long. Korac thinks it dates to the Roman period, since it was built with Roman techniques, but those methods of construction may have still been in use during the Byzantine and medieval periods, he explained. The two smaller boats were carved from single tree trunks, and are thought to have been made by Slavic peoples for crossing the river. No signs of battle damage have been found on the boats, and no artifacts were left behind by the crews. Korac suggests the ship could have been abandoned and scuttled during the invasion to keep it out of enemy hands. Radiocarbon dates from the site could help answer some of these questions, he added. \",A,Roman,Medieval,2,6,\"[2, 6]\",[5 2]\\n18,https://www.archaeology.org/news/9137-201014-china-leather-balls,\"Leather Balls Found in Ancient Graves in Northwest China. ZURICH, SWITZERLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by the University of Zurich , three leather balls recovered from graves in the Yanghai ancient cemetery in northwestern China have been analyzed by an international team of researchers. Two of the balls were found in the graves of horsemen. A composite bow was also found in one of these graves. Patrick Wertmann of the University of Zurich said that the balls, which measure between about three and three and one-half inches in diameter, have been dated to between 3,200 and 2,900 years old, and are therefore about 500 years older than the previously oldest-known balls in Eurasia. Curved sticks have also been unearthed at Yanghai, but they are not as old as the leather balls, he added. The presence of the balls in the graves suggests that ball games may have been part of military training, Wertmann explained. \",A,Bronze Age,East Asia,1,3,\"[1, 3]\",[1 7]\\n19,https://www.archaeology.org/news/8695-200514-england-aerial-images,\"Volunteers Spot New Sites in Aerial Images of England.

Saag and her colleagues obtained usable DNA samples from the teeth of 33 people who lived in what is now Estonia between 3,200 and 2,000 years ago. Their analysis suggests Siberians arrived in the eastern Baltic no later than some 2,500 years ago. The Siberians are also thought to have introduced light eyes, hair, and skin, and lactose intolerance, to the local northern European population.

T\\xc3\\x9cBINGEN, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Science News report, researchers led by paleoanthropologist Katerina Harvati of the University of Tubingen analyzed information collected from more than 100 Neanderthal skulls and 90 Upper Paleolithic modern human skulls and found that the two species suffered head injuries at about the same rate. It had been previously suggested that Neanderthals were more prone to head injuries when compared to modern humans, based upon what was assumed to be a lifestyle filled with combat, hunting with hand-held weapons, and cave bear attacks. The investigation, which accounted for sex, age at death, geography, and state of preservation of the bones, does suggest, however, that males were more frequently injured then females in both species. And while the levels of head trauma for the two groups were similar overall, Neanderthals may have experienced more head injuries earlier in life than modern humans did, and they may have died more often from those wounds. \",A,Pre-Human,Paleolithic,9,10,\"[9, 10]\",[10  9]\\n551,https://www.archaeology.org/news/7136-181109-new-world-migrations,\"Genetic Studies Attempt to Track Peopling of the Americas. ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Science News report, two new genetic studies explore the complex history of the peopling of the Americas. Geneticist Nathan Nakatsuka of Harvard University and his colleagues analyzed samples collected from the remains of 49 individuals, and found that at least three waves of people traveled from North America into South America. The first wave consisted of people\\xc2\\xa0related to a child buried some 12,600 years ago\\xc2\\xa0in Montana with artifacts from the Clovis people. The second wave of migrants replaced them about 9,000 years ago. Then, some 4,200 years ago, people from California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Channel Islands migrated south and spread across the Central Andes. A separate study of the remains of 15 different ancient Americans, led by geneticist Eske Willerslev of the Natural History Museum of Denmark, suggests people living in the Americas were more genetically diverse than had been previously thought. Willerslev\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study confirmed that at least one group living in Brazil possessed DNA similar to that found in modern indigenous Australians, perhaps inherited from a common ancestor. Analysis of DNA collected from a 9,000-year-old baby tooth unearthed in Alaska suggests that the ancient Beringians, who lived on a temporary land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, were genetically distinct from the ancestors of Native Americans. Willerslev also examined the genome of the 10,700-year-old remains discovered in Nevada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Spirit Cave and found that, like the 8,500-year-old Kennewick Man, these individuals were more closely related to modern Native Americans than to any other group. \",A,Paleolithic,Native American,10,8,\"[10, 8]\",[13  8]\\n553,https://www.archaeology.org/news/7134-181109-bulgaria-byzantine-fortress,\"Byzantine Fortress Investigated in Bulgaria.

The excavators investigated the remains of a large building situated near the harbor side of the fortress that may have been part of a large commercial complex. Its roof collapsed when it burned, preserving fragments of amphoras, pots, and jars; intact stacks of roof tiles probably intended for roof repairs; iron farming tools; and parts of a bronze scale. Three coin hoards found in the building helped the researchers to date the fire. Most of the 100 bronze and 10 gold coins found in the hoards depict Emperor Heraclius and his son, Constantine III, the latter of whom ruled for just four months in A.D. 641. The researchers also found traces of the fortress\\xe2\\x80\\x99 southern wall, made from stones and mortar containing crushed ceramics measuring more than five feet wide and surviving more than three feet tall.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\\xe2\\x80\\x94 CNN reports that a team of researchers from the Field Museum of Natural History has analyzed the cargo of a shipwreck discovered in the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia in the 1980s. The ship is now estimated to have sunk in the late twelfth century, while carrying ceramics, cast iron, and luxury trade goods such as elephant tusks and resins used for incense. The wreckage had initially been dated to the late thirteenth century, based upon radiocarbon testing of a single resin sample. But the ocean water is now thought to have affected those test results. The new, more precise, dating of the cargo is significant, according to archaeologist Lisa Niziolek, because it reflects the increase in maritime trade in the twelfth century after the fall of the empire of Srivijaya, which controlled much of the trade in the region, and China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change in trade policy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsequently, the Southern Song dynasty (A.D. 1127\\xe2\\x80\\x931279) court encouraged Chinese traders to go abroad instead of relying on foreign missions traveling to China,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Niziolek said.
