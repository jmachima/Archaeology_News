BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 BBC News reports that an excavation in southeast England under the direction of archaeologist Rachel Wood, ahead of the construction of a high-speed railway line, has uncovered evidence of occupation spanning a 4,000-year period. The finds include traces of a Neolithic wooden henge whose features are aligned with the winter solstice, and the 2,000-year-old remains of a man who was buried face down with his hands bound behind his back. Wood thinks he may have been murdered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe hope our osteologists will be able to shed more light on this potentially gruesome death,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said. In addition to the Iron Age skeleton, the project has uncovered a gold coin dated to about 100 B.C., and a Roman-era lead coffin that also contained a skeleton. This coffin probably had a wooden outer layer, Wood added. \",Neolithic,Iron Age\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8959-200817-tuberculosis-genome-analyzed,\"Genome Study Yields New Date for Arrival of TB in Europe. JENA, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History , an international team of researchers obtained a sample of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis from the well-preserved lungs of Bishop Peder Winstrup of Lund, Sweden, who died in 1679, during an outbreak known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhite Plague.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It had been previously thought that tuberculosis evolved early in human history because it is so widespread among human populations, but analysis of the genome of this Mycobacterium tuberculosis sample, when combined with its known date and other tuberculosis genomes, indicates that the disease emerged just 6,000 years ago, during Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Neolithic period. Team member Denise K\\xc3\\xbchnert said that the rise of pastoralism and more sedentary lifestyles may have contributed to the emergence of the pathogen. \",Medieval,Neolithic\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8988-200831-vindolanda-christian-chalice,\"Early Christian Chalice Unearthed in Northern England.

The images include crosses, angels, a smiling priestly figure holding a crook, fish, a whale, ships, and the chi-rho, a symbol made up of the first two letters of the Greek word for Christ. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just remarkable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said archaeologist Andrew Birley. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing in northwestern Europe comes close from the period.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The chalice also bears letters written in Latin, Greek, and possibly Ogam, an early medieval script.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by New York University , researchers Michael D. Purugganan, Rafal M. Gutaker, and their colleagues combined information about the genomes of more than 1,400 varieties of rice with geographical, archaeological, and historical climate data to trace the spread of rice farming across northern and southern Asia. It had been previously thought that rice diversity was based upon the amount of available water, but the study suggests that temperature may have been the key factor. The researchers determined that the japonica subspecies of Asian rice, which was first cultivated in China some 9,000 years ago, was mainly farmed in China for some 4,000 years, until a global cooling event some 4,200 years ago. At that point, japonica rice split into temperate and tropical varieties. The temperate varieties were grown in northern China, Korea, and Japan, while the tropical varieties spread to Southeast Asia. The researchers explained that this change in varieties of rice some 4,200 years ago is reflected in the archaeological record. The genetic analysis and archaeological record also indicate that tropical japonica rice reached islands in Southeast Asia some 2,500 years ago through trade networks. The indica subspecies of rice, on the other hand, originated in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lower Ganges Valley some 4,000 years ago, and was probably first transported to China some 2,000 years ago.\\xc2\\xa0\",East Asia,South&Southeast Asia\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8787-200610-ireland-long-boat,\"Possible Ancient Longboat Recovered in Ireland. LISACUL, IRELAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Irish Independent reports that a 12-year-old boy discovered the remains of a wooden longboat while wading in a lake in north-central Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s County Roscommon. The vessel may have been built as early as the Neolithic period or as late as the Middle Ages. There is one crann\\xc3\\xb3g, or artificial island, in the lake, which may have been connected to a river thousands of years ago. The boy and his family contacted the Underwater Archaeology Unit of Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht after removing the 17- and one-half-foot piece of wood from the water. The officials advised the family members to return the ancient artifact to the water to help preserve it. \",Neolithic,Medieval\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8589-200413-serbia-viminacium-ship,\"Three Well-Preserved Ancient Boats Unearthed in Serbia. KOSTOLAC, SERBIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ars Technica reports that coal miners in eastern Serbia discovered three boats in what may have been a branch of the Danube River some 1,300 years ago. The site where the vessels were uncovered is near the ancient Roman city of Viminacium, which fell to invaders around A.D. 600. Archaeologist Miomir Korac of the Viminacium Science Project said that the largest of the three boats, which was seriously damaged by the miners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 equipment, had a flat bottom, a single deck, at least six pairs of oars, fittings for a triangular sail, and measured about 49 feet long. Korac thinks it dates to the Roman period, since it was built with Roman techniques, but those methods of construction may have still been in use during the Byzantine and medieval periods, he explained. The two smaller boats were carved from single tree trunks, and are thought to have been made by Slavic peoples for crossing the river. No signs of battle damage have been found on the boats, and no artifacts were left behind by the crews. Korac suggests the ship could have been abandoned and scuttled during the invasion to keep it out of enemy hands. Radiocarbon dates from the site could help answer some of these questions, he added. \",Roman,Medieval\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9137-201014-china-leather-balls,\"Leather Balls Found in Ancient Graves in Northwest China. ZURICH, SWITZERLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by the University of Zurich , three leather balls recovered from graves in the Yanghai ancient cemetery in northwestern China have been analyzed by an international team of researchers. Two of the balls were found in the graves of horsemen. A composite bow was also found in one of these graves. Patrick Wertmann of the University of Zurich said that the balls, which measure between about three and three and one-half inches in diameter, have been dated to between 3,200 and 2,900 years old, and are therefore about 500 years older than the previously oldest-known balls in Eurasia. Curved sticks have also been unearthed at Yanghai, but they are not as old as the leather balls, he added. The presence of the balls in the graves suggests that ball games may have been part of military training, Wertmann explained. \",Bronze Age,East Asia\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8695-200514-england-aerial-images,\"Volunteers Spot New Sites in Aerial Images of England.

In analyzing remains from burials at the sites of Xiyasi and Changxinyuan, bioarchaeologist Melanie Miller and her colleagues found that children were breastfed until they were between the ages of two-and-a-half and four years old, when they were weaned onto foods made from wheat and soybeans. The girls, however, were weaned slightly earlier than the males, Miller said. Females continued to eat more wheat and soy as they grew up, while males ate more millet, she added.

The plants, which were first cultivated in the eastern Mediterranean and southwest Asia, are thought to have been carried northward along trade routes that eventually developed into the Silk Road. Although the area in the Altai Mountains where the grains were found was probably slightly warmer and more humid some 5,000 years ago than it is today, wheat and barley plants are thought to have evolved and adapted to grow in the shorter, colder days experienced in the north. The researchers concluded that the cultivation of such cereals could have helped people to survive in the unpredictable environment of northern Asia. \",Neolithic,East Asia\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8410-200207-ancient-dates-sprouted,\"2,000-Year-Old Date Seeds Sprout in Israel.

The oldest of the new plants date back to the first and fourth centuries B.C., while the youngest date to between the first and second centuries A.D. Sallon said the older seeds are genetically closer to present-day date varieties grown in the Arabian Gulf. The two female plants, she said, resemble modern Iraqi varieties, and may be linked to plants brought back to Judea by Jews exiled in Babylon in the late sixth century B.C.

The chimps did appear to fish more often when they were eating fewer ants, however, and female chimps with young were found to spend more time fishing than males. Koops suggests the sodium, calcium, and fatty acids in the shellfish may be critical to infant and maternal health. Early humans may have fished in forest streams as well, she explained.

TARTU, ESTONIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Gizmodo reports that a new study of genetics, archaeology, and linguistics led by Lehti Saag of the University of Tartu suggests Uralic languages such as Estonian and Finnish can be linked to ancient, migrating Siberian populations. Saag and her colleagues obtained usable DNA samples from the teeth of 33 people who lived in what is now Estonia between 3,200 and 2,000 years ago. Their analysis suggests Siberians arrived in the eastern Baltic no later than some 2,500 years ago. The Siberians are also thought to have introduced light eyes, hair, and skin, and lactose intolerance, to the local northern European population. This information corresponds with linguistic information suggesting that Uralic languages emerged in the Baltic during the period of transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. \",Bronze Age,Iron Age\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7616-190429-china-rock-art,\"Bronze Age Rock Art Discovered in China.

The monument once featured bronze battering rams set in well-fitted niches that had been taken from 35 of the 350 ships captured by Octavian during the battle. Recent excavation and measurement of those niches has allowed archaeologists to calculate the size of the timbers that held the rams and the ships together, and therefore estimate the size of the ships. The largest ship may have been more than 130 feet long and carried rams about five feet tall and eight feet long, or at least four times the size of the largest-known ancient marine battering rams. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth historically and archaeologically, this remarkable Roman structure is of tremendous international importance\\xe2\\x80\\x94and continuing research is likely to shed yet more light on the battle that gave birth to the Roman Empire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Konstantinos Zachos of the Greek Ministry of Culture.

Analysis conducted by Takafumi Matsui of the University of Tokyo indicates that the sample was not obtained from a meteor, as was some early iron, but was produced by the application of fire to iron ore. The composition of the lead in the sample, however, does not match that of iron ore found in the region. Similar lumps were found above a three-foot layer of scorched soil at the site. Traces of wood and mud buildings, which are unlike the sun-dried brick structures usually built in the region during this time period, were found on top of the scorched soil. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt shows that an ancient city that existed there was destroyed on a large scale, and then a group of people came to the area,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Sachihiro Omura of the Japanese Institute of Anatolian Archaeology.

It had been previously suggested that Neanderthals were more prone to head injuries when compared to modern humans, based upon what was assumed to be a lifestyle filled with combat, hunting with hand-held weapons, and cave bear attacks. The investigation, which accounted for sex, age at death, geography, and state of preservation of the bones, does suggest, however, that males were more frequently injured then females in both species.

Geneticist Nathan Nakatsuka of Harvard University and his colleagues analyzed samples collected from the remains of 49 individuals, and found that at least three waves of people traveled from North America into South America. The first wave consisted of people\\xc2\\xa0related to a child buried some 12,600 years ago\\xc2\\xa0in Montana with artifacts from the Clovis people. The second wave of migrants replaced them about 9,000 years ago. Then, some 4,200 years ago, people from California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Channel Islands migrated south and spread across the Central Andes. A separate study of the remains of 15 different ancient Americans, led by geneticist Eske Willerslev of the Natural History Museum of Denmark, suggests people living in the Americas were more genetically diverse than had been previously thought.

SOFIA, BULGARIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to an Archaeology in Bulgaria report, Ivan Hristov of Bulgaria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s National Museum of History and his team have uncovered evidence suggesting the Early Byzantine city of Chrisosotira may have been sacked and burned by the Slavs and Avars in the early seventh century A.D. The excavators investigated the remains of a large building situated near the harbor side of the fortress that may have been part of a large commercial complex. Its roof collapsed when it burned, preserving fragments of amphoras, pots, and jars; intact stacks of roof tiles probably intended for roof repairs; iron farming tools; and parts of a bronze scale. Three coin hoards found in the building helped the researchers to date the fire. Most of the 100 bronze and 10 gold coins found in the hoards depict Emperor Heraclius and his son, Constantine III, the latter of whom ruled for just four months in A.D. 641. The researchers also found traces of the fortress\\xe2\\x80\\x99 southern wall, made from stones and mortar containing crushed ceramics measuring more than five feet wide and surviving more than three feet tall. The placement of the wall indicates that the city was larger than previously thought. \",Roman,Medieval\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7130-181107-quebec-french-fortification,\"17th-Century Palisade Uncovered in Quebec City.

Texts dating back to the third century B.C. have noted that the substance, known as miltos , was mined from specific areas on the Greek islands of Kea and Lemnos, and at Cappadocia in Turkey. Photos-Jones and her colleagues found that modern samples from the different mines each contained a specific mix of chemicals and microorganisms that made them suitable for different uses. For example, some of the samples from Kea had high levels of lead that would have been effective at preventing the growth of slime and other organisms on boat hulls.

Krishna Veeramah of Stony Brook University said that those who were buried with many grave goods, such as swords, shields, and jewelry, had a genetic ancestry similar to that found in modern northern and central Europeans. Those who were buried without extravagant grave goods had genomes resembling those of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s southern Europeans. The different types of burials also suggest the Longobards established the same sort of kinship groups in Italy that they shared while living in Central Europe. Thus, the test results suggest the burials are consistent with the barbarian invasions described by the Romans.

Andr\\xc3\\xa9 Spatzier, an archaeologist at the State Office for the Preservation of Historic Monuments at Baden-W\\xc3\\xbcrttemberg, said the people whose bones were found in the pits may have been killed during an attack or raid, but the lack of adult male remains in the pits, and the presence of broken artifacts among the bones, suggests they could have been sacrificed. Burials of men, whose bodies had been intact, were found to the east of the henge.

Some of the foods eaten by the Danes had been imported, such as figs, grapes, bitter orange, and lemons from the Mediterranean, buckwheat husks from the Netherlands, and cloves from Indonesia.

The inscription, thought to have been a doodle or a scribe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s practice work, include the Roman name Tito and the Celtic name Budic. The Latin words fili , or son or sons, and viri duo , or two men, were also carved into the two-foot ledge. A triangle may represent the Greek letter delta. There is also monogram made up of a letter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cV\\xe2\\x80\\x9d inside it and a line across the top.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\\xe2\\x80\\x94 CNN reports that a team of researchers from the Field Museum of Natural History has analyzed the cargo of a shipwreck discovered in the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia in the 1980s. The ship is now estimated to have sunk in the late twelfth century, while carrying ceramics, cast iron, and luxury trade goods such as elephant tusks and resins used for incense. The wreckage had initially been dated to the late thirteenth century, based upon radiocarbon testing of a single resin sample. But the ocean water is now thought to have affected those test results. The new, more precise, dating of the cargo is significant, according to archaeologist Lisa Niziolek, because it reflects the increase in maritime trade in the twelfth century after the fall of the empire of Srivijaya, which controlled much of the trade in the region, and China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s change in trade policy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsequently, the Southern Song dynasty (A.D. 1127\\xe2\\x80\\x931279) court encouraged Chinese traders to go abroad instead of relying on foreign missions traveling to China,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Niziolek said. New radiocarbon dates and inscriptions on two ceramic box bases helped the team to date the wreck. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis inscription provides a place name, Jianning Fu, which was only assigned that name by the Song government from 1162 until 1278, when it was changed to Jianning Lu by the Yuan dynasty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Niziolek explained. \",East Asia,South&Southeast Asia\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6614-180514-egypt-greek-inscription,\"Greek Inscriptions Found at Roman-Era Temple in Egypt.

The distribution of medieval villages suggests they sat along a Roman road now buried under the current highway system. Other villages were placed around the Neolithic barrows and henges, suggesting those monuments retained cultural significance. At one of the sites, located in what is now the village of Houghton, the archaeologists found that a medieval village of at least 12 buildings had been constructed over the remains of 40 Anglo-Saxon structures, including houses, workshops, and agricultural buildings. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe medieval village was occupied between the twelfth and early fourteenth centuries, and the most likely explanation for its abandonment was that they lost the use of their woods when they were enclosed as a royal forest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Emma Jeffery of Mola Headland Infrastructure.

Stone tools and animal bones were also recovered from the layers. Zhang said the presence of Denisovan genetic material in Baishiya Karst Cave suggests that Denisovans lived on the Tibetan Plateau some 100,000 years ago, and then again 60,000 years ago. DNA in layers dated to between 50,000 and 30,000 years ago further suggest that the hominins could have encountered modern humans, who arrived in the region some 40,000 years ago. Interbreeding with Denisovans may have helped modern humans adapt to living at the high altitude of the Tibetan Plateau, although it is not clear if that mixing took place there.

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Science Alert report, Marlize Lombard of the University of Johannesburg suggests that poison-arrow technology may be tens of thousands of years older than previously thought. She analyzed bone-tipped arrowheads dated to the Paleolithic, and compared them to arrows known to have been used with poison, and arrows known to have been used without poison. Typically, arrows used with poison are smaller because they only need to reach an animal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bloodstream to deliver a deadly substance, while arrows used without poison must inflict a wound that will incapacitate or kill an animal. Lombard found that three out of six bone-pointed arrows recovered from South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Blombos Cave, dating to between 72,000 and 80,000 years ago, resemble poisoned arrowheads, and are so small that they would probably have been ineffective without an added poison punch.

Chipping off flakes from a stone to shape it is a highly skilled process that had been previously thought to be limited to toolmakers who lived in North America between 13,000 and 10,000 years ago. In North America, such fluting is usually found near the base of a point, and is thought to have facilitated attaching it to an arrow or spear shaft with string. In contrast, fluting has been found near the tip on points from southern Arabia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say for sure, but we think this was a way for skilled toolmakers to signal something to others, perhaps that one is a good hunter\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 or dexterous with one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Joy McCorriston of Ohio State University.

Heating the stone would have given the toolmakers more control of the knapping process, but if done incorrectly, the rock would have broken and become unusable. Archaeologist Filipe Natalio of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and his colleagues evaluated two types of flint tools recovered from Qesem Cave with spectroscopic chemical analysis, and then heated flint samples in a laboratory oven in order to estimate the temperatures to which the ancient stones had been heated. They found that the blades had been heated to nearly 500 degrees Fahrenheit, while the flakes had been heated to 775 degrees. Pot lids recovered from the cave had been heated to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. While the study suggests that hominins were able to control fire and manage the resources necessary to keep it burning, the scientists still do not know the techniques the hominins might have employed. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8667-200501-hungary-elongated-heads,Roman,\"Did Skull Shapes Mark Social Changes in the Roman Empire?.

The researchers divided the remains of individuals from 96 graves in the M\\xc3\\xb6zs cemetery, 51 of which had elongated skulls, into three generations who lived between A.D. 430 and 470. The oldest remains in the cemetery were interred in Roman-style graves.

About 30 percent of the oldest burials had elongated heads, while about 65 percent of the middle group and 70 percent of the last group showed signs of head binding. The researchers noted that the placement of grooves in the skulls changed over time, indicating that different binding techniques were used among different groups. Chemical analysis of the bones showed that some of the later residents had been born near the cemetery, while others had settled there after growing up somewhere else. The researchers concluded that residents of Pannonia Valeria mingled and adopted each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cultural habits as the Roman Empire collapsed. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8848-200710-silk-road-cat,Medieval,\"House Cat Remains Found at Medieval Village in Kazakhstan.

Located along the Silk Road, the village was home to the Oghuz, who were Turkic pastoralists. Ashleigh Haruda of MLU said the eighth-century tomcat had several healed broken bones, and had likely been fed by humans because it had lost all of its teeth. She added that the feline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remains were only recovered because the animal had been buried, in contrast to most of the other animal bones recovered from the site, which were found individually. In addition, the chemical composition of the cat bones indicates the animal was fed a diet that contained more protein than dogs whose remains have been found at the site, and to other cats that lived during the same time period. Finally, genetic analysis suggests the cat belonged to the domesticated species Felis catus Linnaeus . The keeping of a pet cat is thought to be an unusual practice for the Oghuz and may be a sign of cultural exchange brought about by contact with Silk Road traders, Haruda and her team concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8829-200629-washington-pipe-residue,Native American,\"New Plant Identified in 1,400-Year-Old Pipe in Washington.

Bos said the yaws genome was only slightly different than the ancestor of all known yaws varieties in humans and other primates, suggesting it developed about 1,000 years ago. The presence of yaws in the medieval grave, she added, could be related to a European outbreak of disease that began in the late fifteenth century, which has usually been attributed to syphilis and the return of Christopher Columbus and his crew from their first New World voyage.

Although clear glass was known in fourth-century A.D. Rome as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlexandrian\\xe2\\x80\\x9d glass, archaeologists have not found furnaces for clear glass production in Egypt. Such furnaces have, however, been found in the Levant. The new technique measures the isotopes of the rare element hafnium in the glass, which can then be matched to the sands used to make the glass, said Gry Barfod of Aarhus University. The study indicates that so-called Alexandrian glass was indeed made in Egypt. Sand from the Nile, the researchers explained, contained lime to keep the high-quality glass stable. Antimony was added to make it crystal clear. Meanwhile, in the Levant, manganese was added to the mix to produce transparent glass. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8524-200316-spain-palace-gate,Medieval,\"Islamic-Era Palace Gate Uncovered in Spain.

NEWCASTLE, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by Newcastle University , Eric Tourigny examined more than 1,000 animal headstones in pet cemeteries in Newcastle and London in order to study changing attitudes toward pets over a period of 100 years, beginning in 1881, when the first public pet cemetery opened in London. Tourigny found that throughout the study period, mourners compared death to sleep. Yet in the Victorian era, headstone inscriptions referred to pets as companions and friends, while more recent inscriptions called the buried pets family members and expressed the hope that the animals would be reunited with their owners more frequently. After World War II, references to animals as family members rose, a change that coincided with the increase in the use of family surnames on pet gravestones. Some of the earlier references put the surname in parentheses or quotation marks. Tourigny suggests this reluctance to acknowledge pets as full members of the family may reflect a conflict between personal feelings and societal norms. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8528-200317-spain-hominin-maturity,Pre-Human,\"Study Suggests Hominins Grew Faster Than Modern Humans.

None of the database participants had two copies of the mutated gene, as the Neanderthals did, but those who had one copy were about seven percent more likely to report having pain than people without the mutation. The researchers note that how the signal was processed in the spinal cord and brain would have also contributed to how Neanderthals experienced pain.

He thinks work on the four sections may not have begun at the same time, in Scotland, as had been previously thought. He says the handwriting of St. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gospel, which was copied on the Scottish island of Iona, indicates it was made by a traditional scribe educated during the mid-eighth century. The book, traditionally the last of the four Christian Gospels, may have been intended to stand alone, since it was especially revered by medieval Celtic Christians.

Zhanyang Li of Shandong University and his colleagues found the artifact in a spoil heap from a well dug at the site in 1958, along with quartz tools, pottery, a pendant made from an ostrich eggshell, animal remains, and another piece of worked bone. Microscopic analysis revealed that the artist used a variety of stone tools and four techniques to create the one-half inch tall representation of a perching songbird standing on a sturdy base. No Neolithic or Bronze Age artifacts were found in the spoil heap, indicating that it is unlikely that the artifact originated in another layer of soil at Lingjing, which dates back more than 100,000 years.

The battle is remembered today as the place where John Laurens, an aide-de-camp to George Washington, and friend of Alexander Hamilton and the Marquis de Lafayette, was killed. Laurens, 140 infantrymen, and artillery soldiers equipped with a howitzer attempted to secure a section of the Combahee River in order to prevent British soldiers stationed in Charles Towne from looting nearby farms. But the British learned of the plan and ambushed the Americans. General Mordecai Gist and his reinforcements were too late to save Laurens, but they caught up with the British, leading to a draw between the two sides. Yianopoulos and his team members used GPS technology and metal detectors to map the locations of dropped and fired musket balls and other artifacts, including an Irish halfpenny dated to 1775, a bayonet, and British grapeshot. They then compared this information to a map of the battle drawn by a British officer, and a lidar image of the surface of the ground, which revealed the locations of two small creeks recorded on the map.

The group of volunteer divers had been planning to document shipwrecks dated to the First and Second World Wars at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland when they spotted the wreckage of the Dutch three-masted ship. The shape of its hull and its lack of guns indicate the vessel was a fluyt, designed by the Dutch to carry twice the cargo of other ships. When combined with a pulley and tackle system for the rigging, the fluyt could be managed by a smaller crew in order to increase the trader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profits. The diving team reports that although the holds of the ship are intact, a trawl appears to have caused some damage. Maritime archaeologist Niklas Eriksson of the University of Stockholm added that the shape of the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stern is unique, which may indicate that it was an early version of the fluyt. Eriksson will continue to investigate the wreckage with the Badewanne Diving Team and the Finnish Heritage Agency of Antiquities. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8837-200706-iran-horse-burial,Iron Age,\"Horse Burial Discovered in Central Iran.

DAVIS, CALIFORNIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94A recent study of crumbled bits of bone tools in museum collections suggests that Neanderthals chose the rib bones of animals from the cattle family, such as bison and aurochs, to make lissoirs, a type of tool used to work animal hides into usable leather, according to a UPI report. Naomi Martisius and her colleagues at the University of California, Davis, analyzed tiny fragments of the well-worn tools with ZooMS, or zooarchaeology by mass spectometery, to identify collagen proteins in the bone. Martisius said cattle have larger, more rigid ribs than deer, which are more commonly found as food waste at Neanderthal archaeological sites, and would have therefore made better scraping tools. Neanderthals are likely to have kept favored lissoirs for a long time, she added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8738-200604-mexico-aguada-fenix,Pre-Columbian,\"Giant Maya Structure Discovered in Mexico.

Before the arrival of the Normans, beef, lamb, mutton, and goat had been more widely consumed. Researchers also found a change in the chemical composition of the pig bones over time. Before the conquest, pigs were likely allowed to forage the countryside, but after the invasion, the animals were fed more protein, suggesting that farming practices intensified and pigs were kept in sties and fed scraps. The chemical composition of the bones of 36 men and women who lived between the tenth and thirteenth centuries indicates that they consumed about the same amount of protein and carbohydrate before and after the invasion, although there was a short period of dietary stress for a few years after 1066. Rickets, scurvy, and other bone conditions brought about by poor diet were rare, however, the researchers added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8890-200729-israel-byzantine-church,Near East,\"Byzantine-Era Church Uncovered in Israel.

The stone, which was carried up a cliff and into the cave, was found covering the remains of several people who died between 14,000 and 12,000 years ago. In all, some 30 burials and ten slabs of rock have been found in the cave. Rosenberg said the other stones may have been painted or decorated in a way that has not survived. Previous studies of Natufian burials from Raqefet Cave have uncovered evidence that the graves were lined with plants. Grave goods such as meat, stone tools, and mortars have also been recovered, in addition to artifacts related to the brewing of alcoholic beverages.

These stone balls were made of dolomite or limestone, which is not found in the area, and they were covered with a different patina than other tools found in the cave, Assaf explained, which suggests the spheres were stored in another environment over a long period of time. Microscopic analysis of the artifacts revealed wear and tear on their ridges, as well as residues of fat, collagen, and bone. The team members recreated the spheres, and used the new tools to break open fresh animal bones.

The oldest of the 130 bone projectile points are thought to have been used to hunt hard-to-catch monkeys, while longer points were eventually crafted to hunt larger pigs and deer. Notches and wear on the points indicate they were used in bow-and-arrow toolkits, the oldest-known weapons of this type to be found outside of Africa. More than 20 of the bone tools are thought to have been used to work animal skins and plant fibers, perhaps to make clothing to serve as protection from insect bites and diseases. It had been previously thought that early clothing was developed as a protection against cold weather. Some of the beads recovered from the cave were made from the pointed tips of marine snail shells, and are thought to have come to the site through trade with people living near the coast. Other beads in the collection are the oldest known to be made entirely of red ochre, the researchers explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8653-200424-ethiopia-medieval-church,Medieval,\"Medieval Church Site Investigated in Ethiopia.

OXFORD, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Science Magazine reports that evolutionary biologist Greger Larson of the University of Oxford, paleogenomicist Pontus Skoglund of the Francis Crick Institute, and their colleagues analyzed the genomes of more than 2,000 dogs who lived in Europe, Siberia, and the Near East as early as 11,000 years ago, and compared them to the genomes of 17 modern humans who lived in the same places at the same times. The researchers found that there were already five distinct domesticated dog lineages some 11,000 years ago. Traces of these lineages can still be found in living dogs, such as the American lineage in Chihuahuas, and the Siberian lineage in Huskies. The study also suggests that wolf genes did not survive in domesticated dogs, even though wolves acquired dog genes. Larson explained that the introduction of wolf DNA into domesticated dogs could have produced poor guard dogs and hunting companions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a dog and you have a bit of wolf in you, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.

For example, farmers from the Near East traveled with their dogs to Sweden, where they lived together some 5,000 years ago. Other migrants adopted local dogs on arrival, however. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8857-200715-australia-riverland-occupation,Paleolithic,\"New Dates Push Back Occupation of South Australia.

Excavation of trash pits at three Negev sites\\xe2\\x80\\x94Elusa, Shivta, and Nessana\\xe2\\x80\\x94turned up some 10,000 grape seeds and wheat and barley grains. By comparing the ratio of grape seeds to cereal grains over time, the researchers found that viticulture in the arid region took off in the fourth century A.D. and was extremely productive for some 200 years before dropping off precipitously in the mid-sixth century. The excavations also uncovered a rise in the number of amphoras dating to this period that were used to transport wine to the port of Gaza for export.

Instead, one of the mummies, which measures 18 inches long and was shaped to resemble Osiris, the god of the afterlife, the dead, life, and vegetation, holds tightly packed grain and mud. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDuring Osiris festivals that were held, [the ancient Egyptians] would produce these,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Ron Hillel of Haifa Museums. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt would be a mixture of clay or sand with these grains, and then they would dip it in water and the grains would germinate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The ritual tied Osiris to death, life and fertility, Hillel explained. The second mummy, which measures about 10 inches long, is bird-shaped and represents the god Horus, the falcon-headed son of Osiris and Isis associated with the sky and pharaohs. Inside, the CT scan revealed the partial remains of a bird, perhaps a falcon. The bird appears to be missing a leg and some of its abdominal organs, and it has a broken neck\\xe2\\x80\\x94an injury thought to have occurred after death.

EXETER, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94Naomi Sykes of the University of Exeter and her colleagues suggest that when chickens and brown hares arrived in Britain sometime between the fifth and third centuries B.C., Britons associated them with gods and revered them, according to a CNN report. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen new animals arrive into a culture, they are often linked with deities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sykes explained. Intact skeletons of the animals, lacking signs of butchery, have been discovered in individual burials from this period, she added. Butchered hare and chicken bones appear in the archaeological record hundreds of years later, among Roman-period food waste. At this time, Sykes said, hares were farmed for food, and the Romans introduced rabbits to the island, although hares and chickens continued to hold religious associations for Britons. After the Romans withdrew from Britain in A.D. 410, the populations of hares and chickens crashed, Sykes said, and rabbits went extinct. Scarcity may have increased their value among Britons, she added. In the medieval period, chickens and eggs became popular foods, since they were allowed within Christian fasting rules. Rabbits became an elite food item in the thirteenth century, and were widely found in Britain again by the nineteenth century, when they were associated with Christian Easter celebrations, Sykes concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8981-200826-hominin-teeth-diet,Pre-Human,\"Tooth Analysis Offers Clues to Timing of Hominin Adaptations.

The results of the study suggest that the animals shifted from eating woody vegetation to grasses and sedges at 2.7 million years ago, and at two million years ago, as the environment shifted to open savannah. Negash and his colleague Jonathan Wynn of the National Science Foundation then examined the chemical composition of the tooth enamel of Paranthropus boisei , an early hominin. The researchers concluded that P. boisei also shifted to eating grasses and sedges some 2.37 million years ago, before the creature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skull and jaw had adapted to the new foods.

John Jenkins of the University of York said the team members used information from historical documents, including eye-witness accounts; surviving fragments of the shrine; and an examination of the site where the shrine stood in Canterbury Cathedral to create the reconstruction. Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, had been engaged in a bitter dispute with King Henry II over the rights of the church when he was slain by knights in the cathedral in 1170. The researchers suggest the shrine was built over a period of about 30 years in the cathedral\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trinity Chapel sometime between 1180 and 1220. It soon became an important medieval pilgrimage site, receiving some 100,000 visitors a year to honor Becket as a saint and a martyr.

The scientists found that the rate of parasitic infection among the individuals in the study stayed fairly stable over time: about 25 percent of them had been infected with whipworm, while about 40 percent were infected with the human roundworm. This rate of parasitic infection is similar to that found today in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Mexico, South America, and East Asia, the researchers explained. The rate of parasitic infection among Europeans dropped by the beginning of the twentieth century, however, probably due to improvements in plumbing, hygiene, and sanitation, since the small, disease-producing worms spread through contact with soil, crops, and water supplies contaminated with infected feces.

Butchered remains found at the lakeshore site suggest such hunting sticks were used to kill rabbits, swans, ducks, and even horses. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9051-200924-iran-chromium-steel,Near East,\"Chromium Detected in Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1,000-Year-Old Crucible Steel. LONDON, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Gizmodo reports that evidence unearthed at Chahak, an archaeological site in southern Iran, suggests that ancient Persians added a chromium mineral to their alloys to produce low-chromium steel in the eleventh century A.D. It had been previously thought that chromium steel, also known as stainless steel, was first produced in the twentieth century. Steel was produced at the site by placing a mixture of iron and other minerals, including about one to two percent chromium and two percent phosphorus, in long, tubular crucibles, which were sealed and warmed in a furnace. After the metal and crucible had cooled, the crucible was broken open and the ingot removed. The addition of chromium made the strong and hard metal, which was probably used to produce swords, daggers, and armor, according to Rahil Alipour of University College London. The phosphorus, however, added to reduce the melting point of the mixture, made it fragile. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cChahak chromium crucible steel would have been similar in terms of its properties to modern tools steel,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Alipour said. Documents from the period noted that blades made in Chahak sold for a high price, but could be brittle. The presence of chromium could be used to identify items produced at Chahak, he added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8867-200721-slovakia-steam-engine,Modern,\"Site of 18th-Century Steam Engine Uncovered in Slovakia.

The structure is thought to have been completed by the warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi in A.D. 1597, one year before his death. The surviving castle wall, which measures about 26 feet long and varies in height from three to five feet tall, is made up of three to four courses of stone. When intact, the wall probably stood about eight feet tall, based upon fallen stones discovered in the backfilled moat, estimated to have been about ten feet wide and eight feet deep. Gold-plated roof tiles bearing the family crest of the Toyotomi family were also recovered from the moat. Historian Kazuto Hongo of the University of Tokyo suggested that Toyotomi Hideyoshi built the castle as a way to pass his rank to his son and successors. Its careful construction was likely intended to inspire admiration in the nobles in the Imperial Palace, added researcher Soichiro Itagaki. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8864-200720-doggerland-tsunami-evidence,Neolithic,\"North Sea Sediments Offer Clues to Impact of Prehistoric Tsunami.

Kaare Lund Rasmussen and his colleagues measured the level of copper in 55 skeletons ranging from 200 to 1,200 years old that were recovered from nine cemeteries in rural and urban areas in Denmark and northern Germany. The researchers found high levels of copper in the bones of people who lived in towns during the Viking and medieval periods, which they believe came from copper pots scraped by metal cooking utensils. Acidic foods stored in copper vessels may have absorbed the metal as well, Rasmussen explained. People who lived in rural areas did not ingest enough copper for it to be detectable in their bones, however. Rasmussen suggests country-dwellers were likely to have prepared their food in pots made of other materials, despite the popular historic image of a country kitchen equipped with a copper pot.

Long celebrated in the West as a great victory, the battle took place on September 7, 1191, when England\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Richard I, or Richard the Lionheart, led his forces against an army commanded by the great Muslim military leader Saladin. The exact location of the battlefield has since been lost. To recover it, Lewis studied a combination of historical and environmental records, and analyzed a network of medieval-era roads to identify an area north of Tel Aviv as the likely site of the battle. A limited survey of the area with a metal detector led Lewis to unearth Crusader-era artifacts, including two arrowheads and a horseshoe dating to the late twelfth or early thirteenth centuries. While the Battle of Arsuf is celebrated as a great victory by European sources, Lewis points out that the Crusaders failed to recapture Jerusalem, the main objective of their campaign. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8526-200317-turkey-istanbul-graves,Modern,\"Graves of Ottoman Soldiers Unearthed Near Istanbul.

The cave is known for its hundreds of Paleolithic engravings depicting animals and humans. The researchers determined from their observations that the human remains, which rest in three locations within the cave, had been placed in hollows dug out and abandoned by hibernating bears. Two of those so-called nests had been covered with red ochre before the human remains were placed there. All of the remains belonged to teenagers and adults, and some of the skeletons were incomplete. For example, in some of the nests, no crania were found, although the teeth had been left behind, Schotsmans noted, suggesting that the people who used the Grotte de Cussac had manipulated the remains.

ITHACA, NEW YORK\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a report in the Olean Times Herald , Sturt Manning of Cornell University and John Hart of the New York State Museum have obtained new radiocarbon dates from Native American sites in upstate New York and created a new timeline for the occupation of the Mohawk and Hudson River Valley regions at the time of European contact. Because Europeans traveled by river from the coast into New York in the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, timelines for Native American settlement of these areas had relied upon the arrival of European goods such as metal items and glass beads. But Manning noted that not all Native American groups accepted contact or goods from Europeans. The researchers thus analyzed metal goods from the settlements with portable X-ray fluorescence to see if they may have been crafted from local materials, collected new radiocarbon dates of organic materials such as maize kernels, and conducted a statistical analysis of archaeological and historical information. The results of the study suggest that the shift to larger, fortified communities at some Iroquoian sites did not occur in the mid-fifteenth century, as previously thought, but between the mid-sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9004-200904-europe-lactase-persistence,Bronze Age,\"Genetic Study Traces Development of Lactose Tolerance.

The study found that only about one in eight of the dead were able to digest the lactose in milk, some 4,000 years after dairy farming had been introduced to Europe. Population geneticist Joachim Burger said that people who live in the region today have genomes largely similar to those buried along the Tollense River, but about 90 percent of them are able to digest milk sugar. Daniel Wegmann of the University of Fribourg said that for such a change to have taken place in just 3,000 years, lactase-persistent individuals must have had more children, or their children must have had a better chance of survival than those who did not carry the genetic adaptation. Burger explained that milk provides energy, and could be less contaminated than drinking water, which may have been a decisive factor in the survival of young children after they were weaned from mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s milk. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8976-200824-universal-facial-expressions,Pre-Columbian,\"Maya and Olmec Sculptures Aid Study of Emotional Expressions.

Previous comparisons of facial expressions of living people have been questioned because of the far-reaching influence of modern Western cultural practices. The new study presented more than 300 English-speakers with photographs of just the faces of sculptures made in Mexico and Central America between 3,500 and 600 years ago, and asked them to assess the statues\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expressions according to a list of 30 emotions or emotional states.

More than 100 other participants were asked to rate how people in those same situations would express the same emotions or emotional states. The study found that the sculptures\\xe2\\x80\\x99 facial expressions aligned with what the participants expected to see, and suggests that humans may have evolved a wider set of facial expression to convey more emotions that had been previously thought. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8547-200326-colorado-internment-camp,Modern,\"Japanese Internment Camp Considered for National Park Status.

Sonar 3-D images and video collected with two remotely-operated unmanned submarines reveal the damage sustained by the submarine when it was rammed by Patrol Boat HMS P-57, which had been fitted with a strengthened bow. The Royal Navy vessel then dropped depth charges on the sunken submarine over a period of several days. Both technologies were developed to fight German U-boats and the plan to prevent the British from transporting coal, steel, timber, and cement by sea. German naval officials suggested after the war that Royal Navy divers had entered the UC-47 to retrieve intelligence documents, including a map of German mines laid against British shipping, but Pacheco-Ruiz said the wreckage rests under more than 150 feet of water, making such an operation unlikely. He thinks the crew of P-57 may have dropped the multiple depth charges in an effort to create holes in the wreckage so that documents could float to the surface. Scholars will search German naval archives for more information on how German officials learned about British intelligence gathering. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8739-200604-arizona-presidio-artifacts,Native American,\"Possible 18th-Century Souvenirs Unearthed in Arizona.

The items had previously been identified as whetstones, but Yanagida suggests they may have been used to mix ink for writing. Such ink slabs usually have hollows where the ink was rubbed and traces of blackish residue. Yanagida noted that pottery from Lelang, a Han Dynasty administrative center established by China on the Korean Peninsula in 108 B.C., has also been found at the Japanese site of Mikumo-Iwara, an ancient capital mentioned in a Chinese record of encounters with Japan. An ink slab dated to the first or second century A.D. was discovered at Mikumo-Iwara in 2016.

Stored in a clay vessel, which had been buried and secured with a nail, most of the coins were minted in the late ninth century A.D., when what is now central Israel was part of the Islamic Abbasid Caliphate. Altogether, the cache would have been enough money to purchase a luxurious house in Fustat, the capital of Egypt, the researchers explained. One of the cuttings is a fragment of a gold solidus minted in Constantinople during the mid-ninth-century reign of Byzantine emperor Theophilos. Coin expert Robert Kool said the presence of the solidus is evidence of contact through war and trade between the two empires. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9033-200917-england-medieval-cemetery,Medieval,\"Anglo-Saxon Cemetery Excavated in the East of England.

The scientists radiocarbon dated charred corn kernels recovered from Cahokia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homes and shrines, and analyzed the carbon isotopes in the teeth and bones of more than 100 people and 15 dogs buried near those structures. The study suggests that the residents of Cahokia began to eat corn at about the same time they began to build mounds and adopt fertility iconography, Emerson said. Around A.D. 1050, the village of Cahokia began to expand rapidly into a city where as many as 10,000 people lived. In addition, archaeobotanist Mary Simon said that some 2,000 years ago, it would have been very difficult to grow corn, which had originally been cultivated in Mesoamerica, in what is now the Midwestern United States because of the difference in the amount of available sunlight. It would have taken time for the plant to evolve and adapt to the new environment, she explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9415-210202-chumash-shell-bead,Native American,\"Shell Bead Study Pushes Back Use of Currency in California.

Historical descriptions note that the battle occurred along the Tagus River, which stretches some 625 miles from the mountains of eastern Spain to Portugal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Atlantic coast. The researchers argue that Hannibal would have chosen to travel to his winter quarters along an ancient route that connected central Spain to the southeast, and would have crossed the Tagus River close to the town of Driebes and the Carpetani-fortified settlement of Caraca. Hannibal is said to have built a defensive wall near the river and placed his cavalry at shallow areas to force the Carpetani to cross in deep, fast-moving waters to avoid his soliders. The researchers note that geologic conditions near Driebes could have preserved the river\\xe2\\x80\\x99s winding course and shallow fords over the past 2,200 years. A survey of the area has also detected traces of a possible man-made structure.

The researchers found that the people who had been buried with trinkets had a distinctive ratio of carbon isotopes in their bones matching that of the local cattle. Meanwhile, the chemical composition of the bones of those people who had been buried without trinkets indicates that they did not feast on beef. The study also found that the cattle had grazed on grasses from sunny, open fields, perhaps because the people who ate them owned the land, the researchers concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8868-200721-vietnam-stone-tools,Paleolithic,\"20,000-Year-Old Artifacts Found in Vietnam.

The burial shaft is connected to a mummification workshop and five other burial chambers dated to the 26th Dynasty (688\\xe2\\x80\\x93525 B.C.), which were unearthed in 2018. Four poorly preserved wooden coffins were found in the sixth chamber. Ramadan B.

Ancient Egyptians were usually buried with four canopic jars, Hussein explained, which held the embalmed lungs, stomach, intestines, and liver of the deceased. Computerized tomography scans of Didibastett\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two extra jars suggest they contain as yet unidentified human tissue. Waziri added that chemical analysis of artifacts recovered from the mummification workshop by scientists from the University of T\\xc3\\xbcbingen, the University of Munich, and the Egyptian National Research Center has detected traces of bitumen, cedar oil, cedar resin, pistachio resin, beeswax, animal fat, and possibly olive oil and juniper oil. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8573-200406-australopithecus-afarensis-brains,Pre-Human,\"Did Early Human Ancestors Enjoy Long Childhoods?. CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\\xe2\\x80\\x94A new study of fossils from Ethiopia suggests that more than three million years ago, Australopithecus afarensis children needed care for an extended period of time, according to a Science News report. It had been previously thought that the small size of infant heads and an extended period of brain development evolved some 2.5 million years ago, in order to accommodate a pelvis adapted to upright walking in the Homo genus of human ancestors. Philipp Gunz of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and a team of researchers scanned the insides of the skulls of six Australopithecus afarensis adults and two children under the age of three at the time of death with synchrotron-computed tomography to examine imprints left by brains, compute their volume, and see how they were organized. Today, modern human brains have a larger prefrontal cortex, and reach adult size at about the age of five, while the brains of chimpanzees and other apes have a smaller prefrontal cortex and reach adult size between the ages of two or three. The study revealed that the organization of the Australopithecus afarensis brains was similar to that of chimpanzees, but their rate of brain growth was more like that of modern humans. Gunz said such an extended period of childhood brain growth might have lowered an infant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nutritional requirements, making a child easier for a mother to feed. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9050-200923-ireland-medieval-monastery,Medieval,\"Medieval Monastery Excavated in Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s County Meath.

The monastery was equipped with a communal latrine, a water system, and a cellar to support between 30 and 50 monks. Previous investigation of the site revealed French jugs and ceramic roof tiles, suggesting the site was inhabited by French Cistercians from Normandy known as De Bello Becco. The monastery also had a gatehouse. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were lucky to find waterlogged deposits which preserved a lot of timber and seeds for us so we can tell by the flat oats and cereal that the monks made and ate sourdough bread,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Stout said.

TEL AVIV, ISRAEL\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Science News report, molecular biologist Oded Rechavi of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues analyzed animal DNA obtained from 26 Dead Sea Scroll fragments in order to study the possible origins of the ancient parchments. After they excluded the DNA left behind by people who handled the scrolls, the researchers determined that two of the fragments were made from cowskin, and the rest were made from sheepskin. Further analysis of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA indicates that eight of the fragments came from closely related sheep, which suggests these documents were all produced in the same place. Previous research of spelling and other elements of the written tradition had indicated that seven of these fragments originated in the Qumran community. Team member Noam Mizrahi pointed out that cows were not raised in the Judean desert, so cowskin scrolls probably originated somewhere other than Qumran. A Qumran fragment from the biblical book of Isaiah was determined to have come from a group of sheep distinct from the Qumran sheep, and so may also have been produced at an unidentified site. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8728-200601-norway-ship-burial,Medieval,\"Second Viking Ship Burial Detected on Norway\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Edoya Island.

The first ship burial, now known as the Edoya ship, was detected on the small island last fall. Manuel Gabler of the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research (NIKU) said the data indicates an object about 24 feet long and three feet wide had been placed inside a circular structure thought to be a round stone cairn. NIKU researcher Knut Paasche added that the long object probably represents the bottom of the boat, and the full vessel would have been long enough to have been propelled by four pairs of oars. The survey also detected a round anomaly in the soil that may have been a burial mound that has been plowed over, two more possible graves, and what could be traces of two houses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe houses that have been traced may well be from the older Iron Age, circa A.D. 300 to 600,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained county conservator Bj\\xc3\\xb8rn Ringstad. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tombs may be from the younger Iron Age, circa A.D. 600 to 900.

One of the forts, located to the west of the Roman town of Caerwent and the Roman legionary fortress at Caerleon, had an inner and an outer defensive structure. The zone in between would have allowed Roman soldiers to attack the enemy with javelins. The Roman marching camp, the third to be identified in Wales, served as a temporary overnight stop with defensive positions and kitchens for soldiers traveling through hostile territory.

The Danish King Hans had loaded the vessel in Copenhagen with prestigious goods for Sten Sture the Elder and the Swedish court in Kalmar as part of his plan to claim the Swedish throne. Osteologist Stella Macheridis said the scutes, or boney plates, in the barrel made it clear that the giant fish was a sturgeon, but researchers had thought it was of the European variety. Recent DNA analysis, conducted by molecular biologist Maria C.

Captured by slave traders in West Africa at the age of two, McCrear arrived in Alabama on the slave ship Clotilda in 1860. The ship is thought to have been scuttled shortly after its arrival in Mobile Bay in an effort to destroy evidence of the journey, because the importation of slaves to the United States had been outlawed in 1808. McCrear, her mother, and one of her three sisters who made the journey were purchased by the same plantation owner, Memorable Walker Creagh. After the abolition of slavery in the United States in 1865, the family worked as sharecroppers. Durkin said McCrear changed her surname, and had a common-law marriage with a white German-born man. They had 14 children.

LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94Archaeologist Debby Sneed of California State University, Long Beach, says that evidence of ramps for use by the disabled has largely been overlooked at ancient Greek temples, according to a Science Magazine report. Sneed looked for evidence of ramps in published excavation reports and visited ancient Greek sanctuaries, focusing on fourth-century B.C. sites dedicated to Asclepius, the Greek god of healing. Sneed said she found evidence of ramps at some sanctuaries that had not been included in excavation reports. For example, Sneed totaled 11 ramps at the main Asclepius sanctuary complex at Epidaurus. A broad stone ramp led to the main temple, while two additional ramps led through the sanctuary gates. Smaller side buildings at the site were also equipped with ramps wide enough for a single walker. The ramps, Sneed explained, would have made it easier for people who walked with crutches or canes, and would also have aided those who were carrying disabled individuals on litters or stretchers. In contrast, she added, just two ramps were found at the massive Sanctuary of Zeus at Olympia. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe distribution is pretty clear: They show up in places where there are more disabled people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sneed concluded. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8719-200527-bulgaria-greek-inscription,Roman,\"Ancient Greek Inscription Discovered in Bulgaria.

The researchers determined that the genetic material on the Neanderthal Y more closely resembles a modern human Y chromosome than that of their close Denisovan cousins. Computational models based upon this information indicate the modern human Y chromosome spread rapidly from father to son through the small Neanderthal populations in Europe and Asia between 100,000 and 370,000 years ago. However, the researchers note, this Y chromosome came from a modern human population that migrated out of Africa and then went extinct. Kelso explained that the modern human Y chromosome may have offered Neanderthals a genetic advantage, especially after modern human mitochondrial DNA, which is passed from mother to child, entered Neanderthal populations some 220,000 years ago. The team members will now try to obtain samples of older Neanderthal Y chromosomes to see if they more closely resemble Denisovan DNA. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8956-200814-europe-syphilis-dna,Medieval,\"DNA Study Tracks Europe\\'s Medieval Syphilis Epidemic.

Most of the 52 possible ritual items in the collection are spherical or conical in shape and made of the resin of the copal tree. The conical artifacts measure between eight and 12 inches tall, and may have been intended to resemble the volcano, according to INAH archaeologist Iris Hern\\xc3\\xa1ndez. The spherical objects are about the size of a baseball, she added. Carbon dating of the objects indicates they were made between A.D. 1216 and 1445, when the Matlatzinca people ruled the Valley of Toluca. INAH researcher Enna Llabr\\xc3\\xa9s Torres said that returning the artifacts to their place of origin for preservation complies with the 2001 recommendation made by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8987-200828-stonehenge-acoustic-model,Neolithic,\"Acoustic Engineers Test Sound in Stonehenge Model.

The researchers then tested the recreated monument in a sound laboratory, just as models of concert halls and opera houses are tested. The study suggests that the strong reverberations of instruments such as drums and lurs, a kind of bronze horn, would have been amplified between ten and 20 percent when played in the monument\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inner sanctum. But these sounds would have been less audible to anyone outside the circle, Cox added, even without a roof on the structure. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith so many stones missing or displaced, the modern acoustics of Stonehenge are very different to that in prehistory,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8826-200629-israel-snakes-lizards,Paleolithic,\"Lizards and Snakes on Prehistoric Menu in Israel.

The lizard and snake bones made up about one-third of the animal bones in the cave. Ma\\xe2\\x80\\x99ayan Lev of the University of Haifa said that finding butchery marks on such small bones can be difficult, especially when they have been weathered over a long period of time. Lev and her colleagues therefore experimented with the bones of modern lizards and snakes to identify signs of erosion, burning, trampling, and digestion by birds of prey, and then compared those marks with marks on the ancient remains. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe most surprising find was the butchery marks on several large whip snake vertebrae,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lev said, adding that the marks were found in identical locations of different bones. These animals were likely eaten by humans, Lev said. The study also suggests the eastern Montpellier snake, the common viper, and other smaller lizards and snakes whose remains were found in the cave were likely eaten by raptors or died of other causes. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9094-201009-neanderthal-stocky-children,Pre-Human,\"Study Evaluates Body Shape of Neanderthal Children.

These characteristics had previously only been noted in Neanderthal adults. To see if Neanderthal children shared the same stocky build or developed it as they grew, the researchers digitally reconstructed the rib cages of four Neanderthal children ranging in age from a couple of weeks to 2.5 years old. Their partial skeletons were found in France, Syria, and Russia, and dated to between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe stocky body shape of Neanderthals not only passed from parents to children, but also probably passed from ancestral species to their Neanderthal descendants,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Garc\\xc3\\xada-Mart\\xc3\\xadnez concluded. This stocky build may have been inherited from Homo erectus , he added. Modern humans may have therefore evolved their longer legs, flatter rib cages, and other identifying features after the split from Neanderthals, by about 300,000 years ago. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8731-200602-turkey-patara-theater,Roman,\"Statue Unearthed in Ancient City of Patara.

Designed to hold 100 to 200 people, the camp was first used to detain political prisoners and then as a concentration camp. By 1943 more than 1,000 people were imprisoned at the camp. The Nazis closed the camp in 1944 and systematically destroyed many of its records. The researchers surveyed the site with remote-sensing technology and examined the surviving vegetation-covered structures. They found that the prisoners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 barracks offered only five feet of space per person, and would have offered little protection from wind and cold, in contrast to buildings occupied by Nazi guards, which were constructed with reinforced concrete and stone to withstand air raids.

The study suggests that the genetic difference between ancient modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans was so small that their hybrid offspring would have likely been healthy and fertile, explaining the presence of traces of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in the modern human genome today. The researchers found that the greater the evolutionary distance between two mammal species, the less likely the match is to produce fertile offspring. Overall, the genetic distance values between early modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans were smaller than those recorded between polar bears and brown bears, which are known to produce healthy, fertile young. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8727-200601-australia-wax-stencils,Paleolithic,\"Was Rock Art in Australia Created With Wax Stencils?.

According to the researchers, the images, which include human figures, crabs, turtles, kangaroo paws, an echidna, boomerangs, and geometric shapes, have curved edges, and are too small to have been made by tracing objects or body parts. Monash University anthropologist John Bradley suggested that the rounded edges may have been formed with molded beeswax stuck to the surface of the rock, since people living in the region continue to use the substance to repair tools and make toys. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur experiments involving heating and shaping beeswax into human figures, animals, objects, and geometric shapes, and then stenciling onto a rock slab confirmed beeswax was an excellent material for making miniature stencils,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bradley said.

Among the objects recovered from the caves were 11,700-year-old stone axes, and fragments of 14,000-year-old axes made of clam shells. Similar objects were traditionally used by people in the region to create dugout canoes.

C. Trevor Duke and his colleagues Thomas Pluckhahn of the University of South Florida and J. Matthew Compton of Georgia Southern University compared animal remains from Roberts Island with those found at an older ceremonial site about one mile away at Crystal River. The researchers said that both of these sites were continually occupied by a small group of locals who likely prepared for visitors. Feasters are thought to have traveled to Crystal River to conduct religious ceremonies and ritual burials containing distinctly decorated ceramics, arrange marriage alliances, and enjoy meals of deer, alligator, shark, and other delicacies. In contrast, those who later gathered at Roberts Island ate mostly oysters, perhaps reflecting lower sea levels and cooler, dryer conditions. Duke and his colleagues suggest the ceremonies were moved to Roberts Island in order to be closer to the dwindling food supply. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8853-200714-ethiopia-bone-ax,Pre-Human,\"1.4-Million-Year-Old Bone Hand Ax Identified.

Known as watercourts, the pens, made of oyster shells and sediment, opened into the canal which bisects the island. The researchers suggest that once a school of fish had been driven from the canal into a watercourt, the pen could have been closed off with a gate or a net. Fish bones and scales at the site suggest mullet, pinfish, and herring were among the catch. Evidence of fires and post molds near the structures may be the remains of racks for drying and smoking fish. Geologist Michael Savarese of Florida Gulf Coast University said that the amount of organic material in the soil indicates that the watercourses had poor water circulation, and were probably only used for short-term storage while the catch was processed. Such fishing practices would have allowed the Calusa to create a surplus of food to feed large numbers of workers who were otherwise occupied with the construction of canals, shell islands, and large buildings, the researchers explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8556-200331-lene-hara-cave,Paleolithic,\"Possible Pleistocene Rock Art Discovered in East Timor.

Atmospheric modeling indicates that the lead in the ice core was carried to the European Alps on winds from British mines, and tax records show that in the late twelfth century, lead and silver were mined in England\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Peak District and in Cumbria. Becket was assassinated by four knights in 1170 after a disagreement with King Henry II over the powers of the church. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo get himself out of jail with the Pope, Henry promised to endow and build a lot of major monastic institutions very, very quickly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Loveluck said. The massive amount of lead used to roof the monasteries is reflected in the amount of pollution in the ice core, he explained. The level of lead in the atmosphere at the time was similar to the amount of pollution recorded in the Industrial Revolution of the late nineteenth century, he added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8687-200511-croatia-artillery-weapon,Medieval,\"Historic Weapon Unearthed in Croatia.

The radiocarbon dates suggest that many of the bone artifacts belonged to contemporaries of the grave occupants, while the micro-computer tomography scans revealed that some of the bone artifacts came from cremated remains, some of the bones had been exhumed after burial, and other came from bodies that were allowed to decompose on the surface of the ground. Thomas Booth of the University of Bristol said the varied treatment of the remains indicates there was no established protocol for the treatment of bodies whose bones would be preserved as keepsakes. These people may have been played an important role in the community, or they may have been family members, friends, or even enemies. The artifacts may have served as relics to remember individuals within living memory, or as aids to telling stories about them. For example, a human thigh bone that had been carved and polished into a musical instrument was recovered from a grave at a Bronze Age archaeological site near Stonehenge. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9089-201008-greece-coins-repatriated,Iron Age,\"Ancient Silver Coins Repatriated to Greece.

BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) , a team of researchers led by Axel Timmermann of the IBS Center for Climate Physics created a supercomputer model to simulate possible scenarios for the collapse of Neanderthal populations between 38,000 and 43,000 years ago. The migration of Neanderthals and modern humans, their interactions and interbreeding, and the rapidly fluctuating climate of the period were all taken into account, Timmermann said. The results produced by the computer model were then compared with anthropological, genetic, and archaeological data. The scientists concluded that competition with modern humans alone was responsible for the extinction of the Neanderthals. Possible reasons for the modern human advantage may have been better hunting techniques, stronger immune systems, or higher birth rates, Timmermann added, while pointing out that Neanderthals survived in Eurasia for 300,000 years only to go extinct around the same time that modern humans arrived on the scene. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8554-200330-rhode-island-cemetery,Modern,\"Historic African American Cemetery Mapped in Rhode Island.

The cemetery, in use between 1720 and 1990, holds the remains of generations of free and enslaved people, some of whom were born in Africa. The map, created using 3-D photogrammetry and images captured through the use of a drone, will be linked to a database of information engraved on headstones, which can include the names of the deceased, birth and death years, the names of relatives, epitaphs, and occupations. Such information is rarely available for enslaved people, who were not recorded during the census in early Newport history. Marko said that the project, when completed, will be available to the public, and will allow anyone to search the cemetery for information about a particular family or for people who died during a particular year. The map will also allow users to see how the cemetery evolved over time. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8712-200522-germany-scavenged-elephant,Pre-Human,\"300,000-Year-Old Scavenged Elephant Found in Germany.

Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Gal\\xc3\\xa1n, a member of a joint Spanish and Egyptian archaeological mission, said the anthropoid coffin was carved from a single sycamore tree, coated with whitewash, and painted red. The poorly preserved mummy of a girl, aged approximately 15 years old at the time of death, was found resting on her side inside the coffin. She was wearing two spiral-shaped earrings coated with metal in one ear, and two rings, one made of bone and the other of metal, string, and a blue glass bead. A total of four necklaces fastened together with a faience clip rested on her chest. One of the necklaces was made of amethyst, carnelian, amber, blue glass, and quartz beads. The small mud coffin contained a wooden ushabti figurine wrapped in four linen bandages.

The presence of a Homo heidelbergensis shin bone suggests that a group of the possible human ancestors had gathered at the site to butcher a horse carcass. More than 2,000 flintknapping scatters, found in eight separate areas of the site, were reassembled by the researchers, who found that each pile had been left behind during the shaping of a biface knife. These implements were then probably used to butcher the horse. The animal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flesh was removed, and its bones were smashed to remove marrow and grease, creating enough food to feed as many as 40 people. Marks on some of the horse bones indicate that they were used as retouchers to continue to shape the flint knives.

Auroras, he explained, are ribbon like, and wave across the sky. Comets rarely appear to be red, he added. When Kataoka adjusted for the magnetic latitude of Japan in A.D. 620, however, he and his team members found that an aurora may have appeared to have a pheasant-tail shape, especially during a strong magnetic storm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis means that the A.D. 620 phenomenon was likely an aurora,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8859-200716-oregon-human-coprolites,Paleolithic,\"14,000-Year-Old Fossilized Feces Retested.

Paleoanthropologist Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution said that chemical and microscopic studies of the layers in the sediment core revealed that some 400,000 years ago, volcanic eruptions reduced the size of lakes and the amount of available water, while the climate fluctuated dramatically. As large animals died out, they were replaced by smaller ones with more diverse diets, he explained.

Remains of wolves, which were bigger than the dogs and had distinct molars for tearing meat apart, were also found in the caves. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe remains found at Apulia represent to date the oldest specimens discovered in the Mediterranean area and could also represent the until-now missing evidence of the evolutionary process that led to the dog, the very first domesticated animal,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Francesco Boschin of the University of Siena. Genetic analysis of the remains indicates that one of these dogs was related to a dog who lived about 14,000 years ago whose remains were unearthed in Germany. The animals may represent a cultural link between the two groups of people, Boschin added. He suggests that people and dogs migrated to southern Europe in search of warmer temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8724-200529-banco-chinchorro-shipwreck,Modern,\"200-Year-Old Shipwreck Found in Caribbean Sea.

Avocational diver Gary Lefebvre spotted the first paddlewheel near Lake Champlain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Colchester Shoal while exploring with a remotely operated vehicle. He alerted researchers at the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, who said the location of the wreckage, the style of the construction, and the charred condition of its timbers suggest the paddlewheel came from the Phoenix . A second look in the area with the remotely operated vehicle found a second, charred paddlewheel. Chris Sabick, director of research and archaeology at the museum, said that on the night of September 4, 1819, the paddlewheels located on either side of the Steamboat Phoenix tore loose from the vessel as its center burned and fleeing passengers boarded lifeboats and jumped into the water to escape. The hull continued to burn to the waterline as it drifted south and came to rest on Colchester Shoal reef, he added.

A group of Neolithic huts was found on an adjacent hillside in 2015, although Fewings explained that the cairns are thought to be slightly older than the settlement. Over time, the stones in the cairns would have weathered and faded in color, and were probably reused by farmers to build walls and other structures, he added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9090-201008-brazil-amazon-food,Pre-Columbian,\"Amazonia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pre-Columbian Diets Analyzed.

Previous attempts to understand the system of fractions were complicated by damaged documents and the contradictory use of certain signs\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps because the system changed over time. The researchers therefore limited the study to documents dated to between 1600 and 1450 B.C. They then combined the study of the fraction sign shapes and their use in inscriptions with statistical, computational, and typological strategies to assign them mathematical values. After excluding impossible outcomes, the computation yielded nearly four million possible solutions. Typological data were then used to compare the results with fractions commonly found in use in history. Statistical tests also helped to trim the list of possibilities. Ferrara and her team concluded that Linear A\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lowest fraction was 1/60. The study also suggests that the Linear B script used by Mycenaean Greek culture between 1450 and 1200 B.C. reused some of these fractions as units of measurement. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9053-200925-italy-repatriation-turkey,Iron Age,\"Italy Hands Over Stolen Ancient Artifact to Turkey.

Population geneticists David Reich and Nathan Nakatsuka of Harvard University, paleogenomicist Lars Fehren-Schmitz of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and their colleagues note that genes flowed between these groups in the Andes, and with populations living outside the Andes, but the exchanged slowed about 2,000 years ago. These regional genetic differences persist today, they added. This genetic continuity suggests that the fall of Andean cultures such as the Moche, Wari, and Nazca was not the result of massive immigration, and that local people did not die out when they were invaded. In contrast, they added, people living in the cosmopolitan urban centers of the Tiwanaku and Inca cultures came from varied genetic backgrounds. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8953-200813-iran-parthian-tombs,Iron Age,\"2,000-Year-Old Burials Uncovered in Iran.

JENA, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Cosmos Magazine report, an international team of researchers examined the ratios of stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes in collagen and dental enamel samples obtained from the remains of some 130 individuals who were buried in Mongolia between 4500 B.C. and A.D. 1300. The analysis suggests that during the Bronze Age, the Mongolian diet was based on milk and meat and supplemented with local plants. From about the third century B.C. to the late first century A.D., during the Xiongnu Empire, some people continued to eat the Bronze Age diet, while those living in political centers began to eat more millet-based foods. Grain consumption and thus the practice of agriculture appears to have continued to increase into the period of the Mongolian Empire of the Khans. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNamely, instead of roving hoards, these empires were supported by pastoralists and farmers practicing different subsistence strategies that provided strength in diversity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained Shevan Wilkin of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8500-200303-ireland-neolithic-bru-na-boinne,Neolithic,\"Possible Neolithic Features Spotted in Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s River Boyne.

This weapon is thought to have belonged to a legionary infantryman, an auxiliary infantryman, or a centurion. Tremmel said the dagger has an iron blade with deep grooves and a long, tapering point. Its handle is inlaid with silver and decorated with rivets. The sheath, also made of iron, was lined with linden wood and decorated with red glass; silver; black trim made of sulphur, copper, silver, and lead; and red enamel.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by UChicago Medicine , a new study suggests that Sardinians experienced less genetic turnover than populations living in mainland Europe, where large-scale migration is thought to have occurred during the Bronze Age. An international team of scientists analyzed the genomes of 70 Sardinians whose remains were recovered from more than 20 archaeological sites spanning a period of about 6,000 years. The scientists then compared the Sardinian DNA to DNA collected from other ancient and modern peoples. The researchers determined that Neolithic Sardinians were closely related to their contemporaries in mainland Europe. Sardinian genetic ancestry remained stable through 900 B.C., at a time when populations in mainland Europe began to shift and mix as people from other regions moved across the continent. It had been previously thought that a new style of stone tower that appeared on Sardinia around 900 B.C. may have been constructed by Bronze Age arrivals. The study of Sardinian genomes did detect population movement on the island in later periods, however, such as the arrival of the Phoenicians from what is now Lebanon, and the Punics, from what is now Tunisia, as early as 500 B.C. During the Roman and medieval periods, the scientists also found evidence of migration to the island from Italy and Spain. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8487-200227-virginia-custis-square,Modern,\"Archaeologists Investigate 18th-Century Virginia Garden.

JENA, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cosmos Magazine reports that humans may not have been as severely impacted by the eruption of Mount Toba in Indonesia some 74,000 years ago as had been previously thought. Researchers had suggested the eruption triggered a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvolcanic winter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that cooled Earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface for a period of 1,000 years, resulting in the near-extinction of hominins. In this scenario, members of a small populuation of modern human survivors in Africa were thought to have migrated along the coast of the Indian Ocean and repopulated Asia some 60,000 years ago. But, according to J.N. Pal of the University of Allahabad, stone artifacts unearthed in northern India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Middle Son River Valley indicate the region has been continuously inhabited for the past 80,000 years. The artifacts are similar to tools found in Arabia that date to between 100,000 and 47,000 years ago, and 65,000-year-old tools uncovered in Australia. The tools could therefore be linked to the dispersal of early modern humans out of Africa, added Chris Clarkson of the University of Queensland. The researchers explained that the evidence for thriving modern human populations at the time of the eruption also supports fossil and genetic evidence for the modern human migration out of Africa and intermixing with other species of hominins more than 60,000 years ago. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8485-200226-mexico-maya-sacbe,Pre-Columbian,\"Lidar Study Reveals Towns Along Sacred Maya Road.

Two of the genomes, found in the remains of hunter-gatherers who lived in what is now Russia, are from strains of the pathogen that cause miscarriages in horses and sheep. The other six genomes, recovered from ancient farmers and pastoralists, include the progenitor of a rare strain of bacteria that can now be deadly to humans, but in the past would have caused a milder form of illness in both humans and animals. The analysis also suggests that early farmers picked up Salmonella enterica from an unknown animal host, rather than from domesticated pigs some 4,000 years ago, as had been previously thought. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8482-200225-turkey-stele-luwian,Iron Age,\"Inscribed Stone in Turkey Offers Clue to Lost Iron Age City.

Matchan explained that the structure of the volcanoes suggests they grew their peaks within a period spanning just days to months. The researchers think an ancient story told by the Aboriginal Gunditjmara people about four giant beings, one of whom transformed into the Budj Bim volcano, might reference this volcanic activity and could reflect an oral tradition that has lasted for tens of thousands of years. Previous analysis of hair samples indicate that many Australian populations have occupied the same regions for nearly 50,000 years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs with all First Nations around the world, our stories, heritage, identity and survival are connected to our traditional homelands and waters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Damein Bell of Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8458-200213-colorado-petroglyphs-mapped,Native American,\"Colorado Petroglyphs Mapped With High-Tech Tools.

The first temple on the site has been tentatively dated to the tenth century B.C., while the monumental temple complex built on top of it has been dated to the late tenth century to early ninth century B.C. Kisilevitz said the temple complex at Motza conformed to religious conventions in the Kingdom of Judah at the time, but according to biblical texts, King Hezekiah and King Josiah restricted worship to the structure known as Jerusalem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s First Temple. The presence of the temple complex in Motza, she added, therefore suggests that other temples continued to operate outside of Jerusalem. Motza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s local leaders may have built the temple complex to increase their control over the region and bolster the success of the growing grain distribution business, she explained. Cultic artifacts including human-shaped and horse figurines, a cult stand decorated with lions or sphinxes, a stone altar, a stone offering table, and a pit filled with ash and bones have been uncovered at the site. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8448-200212-england-cremated-bone,Iron Age,\"Iron Age Bone Fragments Unearthed in Northeast England.

Although the game became popular among Egyptians some 5,000 years ago as a purely entertaining pastime, tomb art from about 700 years later shows deceased individuals playing senet against living relatives. By the early New Kingdom, symbols on the game board had changed. Egyptian texts mention that the game had taken on religious significance, reflecting a soul\\'s journey to the afterlife through Duat, the realm of the dead. Maastricht University archaeologist Walter Crist said the Rosicrucian board, which he has tentatively dated to the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca. 1550\\xe2\\x80\\x931295 B.C.), appears to be an early example of the redesigned game. One of its squares, which in earlier versions of the game was marked with an X, features the hieroglyph for water, believed by scholars to represent a body of water the soul encountered on its way through Duat. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may be one of the first times that this aspect of the journey through the afterlife is visually rendered on the board,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Crist. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8413-200210-england-iron-age-hoard,Iron Age,\"Iron Age Gold Coin Hoard Declared Treasure.

First excavated from a quarry in east London over a period of three months in 2019 and dating to between 900 and 800 B.C., the Havering Hoard is a staggering haul of 453 swords, axes, kives, chisels, sickels, ingots, and bracelets. It is the third largest Bronze Age hoard ever discovered in the United Kingdom. Examination of a pair of rings suggests they may not have adorned fingers but rather were used to prevent rein tangling on horse-drawn carts.

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 BBC News reports that researcher Damien Finch of the University of Melbourne used ancient mud wasps\\xe2\\x80\\x99 nests to date the so-called Gwion style of rock art found in northwestern Australia. Finch noted that, while encasing insect prey in mud, wasps often collect fragments of charcoal from the ground that can be radiocarbon dated. The wasps then affix the mud structures onto rock faces. Traces of this mud has been found under rock art, which provides its maximum possible age, while mud found on top of the rock art gives its minimum age, Finch explained. By collecting dates from artwork all over the region, he estimates the oldest images date back about 12,000 years, rather than 16,000 years ago, as previously thought. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll this is important because we can now begin to match the rock art with other types of information we are getting in the Kimberley, such as the stone tools that are uncovered by archaeologists and what we understand was happening with the climate and sea levels,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Finch said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8406-200206-mexico-paleoindian-skulls,Paleolithic,\"Newly Recovered Paleoindian Bones Examined.

The remains are thought to have belonged to a woman who died at about 30 years of age. Her skull resembles other Paleoindian skulls found in the cave, and she also had cavities in her teeth. Stinnesbeck said other skulls unearthed in North America from this time period are usually longer and narrower than the skulls from the Tulum cave. In addition, their teeth are worn, without cavities, suggesting that their diet included hard foods. Stinnesbeck and his colleagues think the differences they observed in skull morphology could be evidence of more than one group of migrants to the Americas, or the result of the isolation of a small group on the Yucat\\xc3\\xa1n Peninsula. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8405-200205-hunter-gatherer-pottery,Paleolithic,\"Study Explores the Origins of Pottery in Asia. YORK, ENGLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by the University of York , scientist Oliver Craig and his colleagues analyzed residues on prehistoric pottery fragments recovered from archaeological sites along the Amur River in eastern Russia and from archaeological sites in Japan. Craig explained that the pots at each location had been manufactured in different ways between 16,000 and 12,000 years ago, and were likely invented independently by different groups. For example, pots recovered along the lower Amur likely held salmon and freshwater fish, while pots from the middle Amur held traces of fats from ruminant animals such as cattle, sheep, or goats. Craig and his team suggest that individual hunter-gatherer communities living in Northeast Asia, when faced with harsh Ice Age conditions, invented pottery so that they could cook their food and thus extract more nutrition from it, boosting their chances of survival. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8403-200204-japan-written-language,East Asia,\"When Did Written Language Reach Japan?.

The newly discovered building at the site dates to about 600 B.C., and was rectangular in shape, with a basement and mosaic floors. Vassilis Lambrinoudakis of the University of Athens said the structure was demolished to make room for the Tholos, where patients are known from historical records to have slept in the basement in order to dream of Asclepius, who would reveal a cure for illness. The newly uncovered building also had a basement space, and probably also served a similar function, he added. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis means the worship of Asclepius appears to have begun earlier in the Asclepeion of Epidaurus.

LOUIS, MISSOURI\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a statement released by Washington University in St. Louis , a study of the wear and tear caused by food particles on tooth enamel suggests human ancestors may have eaten more hard plant foods than previously thought. Biological anthropologist Adam van Casteren explained that early hominins such as Australopiths had very large teeth and jaws, and probably also had huge chewing muscles that would have allowed them to crush nuts, seeds, tubers, and woody plant material. Scientists predicted such a diet would leave microscopic pits on fossilized hominin teeth, but most known specimens do not show this kind of wear and tear. So, Van Casteren and his colleagues dragged tiny pieces of seed shells across a Bornean orangutan molar, and observed the wear and tear they caused. The researchers found that the seed fragments did not leave behind any pits, scratches, or fractures in the orangutan molar, even though the seed particles began to break down as if they had been chewed. Van Casteren and his colleagues suggest the study will help researchers figure out what our earliest ancestors actually ate. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8365-200120-england-chester-wall,Roman,\"Section of Roman Wall Collapses in Chester, England.

Animal teeth found alongside the tools were dated to between 90,000 and 100,000 years ago, when Neanderthals are thought to have been the only hominins living in Western Europe. The tools, which are thought to have been used as scrapers, were made from the shell of a clam known as Callista chione, which lives in coastal waters at least three feet deep. Paola Villa of the University of Colorado Boulder said microscopic evaluation revealed that almost a quarter of the shell tools did not show signs of the wear and tear usually seen on shells collected on the seashore after being tossed in the waves. Rather, these shells were smooth, as if they had been harvested while still holding a live clam. It is not clear if the clams were eaten, however. Villa and her colleagues also found lumps of volcanic rock in the collection that may have been collected from the beach. Such pieces of pumice are known to have been used by early modern humans to polish pieces of bone. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8357-200116-mexico-mexicapan-house,Pre-Columbian,\"600-Year-Old Foundations Unearthed in Mexicapan.

When Christopher Columbus arrived in the Bahamas in 1492, he recorded conflicts between the indigenous Arawak and Caribs, whom he described as marauding cannibals. But researchers lacked evidence showing that the Caribs had actually migrated so far north, and therefore doubted the accuracy of the explorer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account. The new test results and archaeological evidence suggest that Carib settlers from the Yucat\\xc3\\xa1n Peninsula reached the Caribbean around 5000 B.C., and they then traveled to Cuba and the northern Antilles, while Arawaks from Colombia and Venezuela arrived in Puerto Rico between 800 and 200 B.C. The study also indicates that Caribs from the northwest Amazon were the first to arrive in the Bahamas and the island of Hispaniola. Keegan said this migration pattern fits with the spread of a unique pottery type as well. He and Ross now think Columbus may have actually encountered the Caribs, but they said that there is still no real evidence that the Caribs practiced cannibalism. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8352-200114-olduvai-stone-tools,Pre-Human,\"Study Reveals Material Selection in Early Stone Age Tool Design.

Key said the study suggests that Early Stone Age toolmakers considered edge sharpness, cutting force, durability, and availability when choosing between different types of stone. For example, quartzite, Key explained, produced the sharpest tools, but was the least durable, and so was often chosen for flake tools, which are thought to have been used for short-term cutting activities. Chert, which was more durable than quartzite, produced tools that were almost as sharp, and was chosen for tools used for long periods of time. Hominins thus optimized their tools for specific circumstances, Key said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8350-200113-japan-gifu-castle,East Asia,\"Sixteenth-Century Wall Unearthed at Japan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gifu Castle.

The data suggests that fast-growing, second-growth forests appeared in the late seventeenth century, at about the time that Native Americans are thought to have abandoned their cleared land. A drought in the late seventeenth century in eastern North America may have also thinned forests and brought about a surge in regrowth, de Graauw explained.

Made up of more than 80 percent water, brains usually decompose quickly due to the action of enzymes present in human tissues. Petzold and his colleagues found that the outer areas of the Heslington brain still had proteins in place that normally act like scaffolding and maintain brain structure. But, the proteins had folded together even more tightly after death, and had caused the Heslington brain to shrink and become more compact. The scientists also observed this process in another brain about three months after death. They suggest that some sort of acidic fluid may have come in contact with the remains and deactivated the enzymes usually responsible for decomposition. Further research into such brain protein folding and unfolding could be useful for the study of neurodegenerative diseases, Petzold added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8341-200108-australia-rock-art,Paleolithic,\"Rock Art Destroyed at Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Baloon Cave.

The charred rhizomes were recovered from fireplaces and ash dumps at South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Border Cave, which is located in the Lebombo Mountains, and identified with a scanning electron microscope as Hypoxis , a plant also known as the Yellow Star flower. The researchers suggests that a wooden digging stick discovered in the cave may have been used to dig such rhizomes out of the ground. Wadley also explained that cooking the rhizomes would have made them easier to peel and digest. She thinks that since the rhizomes were cooked in the cave, rather than in the field, they may have been shared with others who shared the cave as a home base. Today, the plant is still valued for the nutrition, energy, and fiber it provides. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8333-200103-assyrian-demon-drawing,Iron Age,\"Demon Drawing Spotted on Assyrian Clay Tablet.

Earlier this year, a second lower molar with three roots was identified in a Denisovan mandible discovered on the Tibetan Plateau. Shara Bailey of New York University and her colleagues suggested that that unusual tooth may be evidence of a link between Denisovans and modern Asian populations, where as many as 40 percent of people have three-rooted molars, compared to just 3.5 percent of non-Asians. The new CENIEH-led study points out that it is the first molar, and not the second, where a three-rooted tooth is more likely to be found in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Asian populations. Martin\\xc3\\xb3n-Torres and her colleagues also note that the third root found in the first molars of modern Asian populations has a different size, shape, and position than the Denisovan third root in the second molar.

The researchers also unearthed thousands of flakes of gold leaf that once papered the tombs\\' walls, amber from the Baltic, imported carnelian, and a gold pendant with an engraved depiction of the head of the Egyptian goddess Hathor dating to the 15th century B.C. The artifacts suggest that Pylos may have been a much more important stop along the Bronze Age Mediterranean trade route than was once thought. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8296-191216-mexico-maya-bones,Pre-Columbian,\"Bones of Possible Maya Prisoners of War Analyzed. BONN, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94Researchers including Nicolaus Seefeld of the University of Bonn and scientists at the Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at the National Autonomous University of Mexico have analyzed human remains recovered from a 1,400-year-old mass grave in a well at Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Maya site of Uxul. The collection of bones represents at least 20 people, including 14 men, one woman, adolescents, and an 18-month-old child who was decapitated and dismembered. Heat marks indicate the remains had been exposed to fire, perhaps to assist with the removal of skin and flesh from the bones. Different regions of the world have characteristic strontium isotope ratios in their soils, which are reflected in the ratios of strontium isotopes in a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tooth enamel. Because tooth enamel is formed during childhood, the process allows scientists to determine where an individual grew up. Strontium analysis of the teeth of 13 of these individuals indicates that some of them grew up at least 95 miles away, in what is now Guatemala. At least one adult and one infant were local residents of Uxul. Overall, eight of the individuals are thought to have been of high social status, since they had elaborate jade tool jewelry or engravings in their incisors. Seefeld and his colleagues suggest the treatment of the remains was a demonstration of power over prisoners of war. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8295-191216-child-sized-atlatls,Native American,\"Study Suggests Children Practiced Throwing Child-Sized Atlatls. EDMONTON, CANADA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Live Science reports that researchers led by Robert Losey of the University of Alberta examined more than 90 atlatls and fragments of such weapons recovered from the Par-Tee shell midden in the 1960s and 1970s. Located on the northern coast of Oregon, the site was created by Native Americans more than 1,000 years ago. Careful measurement of the atlatls, which were carved from whale bone with a grip at one end and a hook for a dart on the other, revealed that the largest was 166 percent bigger than the smallest, a size difference much larger than the variations found among adult-sized hands. Thus, the researchers suggest the smaller weapons were used by children to master the skill of dart throwing, which would have been critical to their survival. Previous tests conducted with smaller atlatls found the weapons to be highly effective, in that they could hurl a dart some 100 feet. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8294-191216-cyprus-roman-road,Roman,\"Roman Urban Planning Techniques Investigated in Cyprus. SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 In-Cyprus reports that Craig Barker of the University of Sydney and his colleagues investigated Roman infrastructure in the vicinity of the theater at the site of Nea Paphos, which is located in southwest Cyprus. The theater was constructed in 300 B.C. for dramatic performances and was eventually used by the Romans as an arena that could be flooded for water spectacles. In A.D. 365, the theater was destroyed by an earthquake. The recent investigations exposed the Roman road to the south of the theater. It was constructed with limestone pavers, ran east-west to the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s northeastern gate, measured nearly 28 feet wide, and was equipped with a drainage system. Wheel ruts in the road indicate it was used by vehicular as well as foot traffic. Barker and his team also found debris of the fourth-century earthquake on the road surface, and evidence that its stone blocks were reused in later periods. Some 100 feet to the south, evidence of a pathway covered in rubble was uncovered, along with building foundations and fragments of painted plaster. Barker said the position of the road and the pathway helped to confirm the size of city blocks in the region around the theater. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8289-191213-england-pocklington-shield,Iron Age,\"Restoration of Iron Age Shield Reveals Elaborate Decorations.

MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Science News reports that remnants of two cone-shaped headpieces have been found for the first time in burials in the ancient Egyptian city of Amarna by archaeologist Anna Stevens of Monash University and her colleagues. When depicted in paintings, the cones adorn the heads of prominent and powerful individuals, so some archaeologists have expected to find such cones in elite graves, and speculated that they may have been scented. In the 3,300-year-old graves at Amarna, however, one cone was discovered on the head of a woman who died in her 20s, while the other was found with the remains of a person of undetermined sex who died between the ages of 15 and 20. Their names and occupations are unknown, Stevens said. Examination of the cone remnants with portable infrared and X-ray machines showed that they were made of wax and were hollow, but the researchers have found no trace of scented resins or perfumes, which may have evaporated, in the artifacts so far. Stevens suggests the headgear may have been intended to provide assistance in the afterlife. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8283-191211-chichen-itza-table,Pre-Columbian,\"Carved Limestone Slab Uncovered in Chichen Itza.

The piece of copper was found in what had been one of ten postholes for the largest timber structure. Michael Thorsen of the Bornholm Museum said the metal may have been part of a larger ax that had been buried as part of a sacrifice. He suggests the ax had not been made locally, but was imported from the Mediterranean or the Balkans, where people were producing copper objects at that time. The building may have been used for rituals or as a place for housing the dead before it was ceremonially demolished and its postholes filled in with burned grain, burned stone axes, and the copper ax. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor me, it just makes the structure even more important, because they were offering a rare piece of copper like this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Thorsen said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8277-191209-africa-eggshell-beads,Paleolithic,\"Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ostrich Eggshell Beads Offer Hints of Cultural Contact.

Such beads date back to more than 40,000 years ago and have been unearthed throughout Africa. Miller and Sawchuk measured 1,200 beads recovered from 30 archaeological sites spanning a 10,000 year period in southern and eastern Africa and compared the data with other archaeological evidence of cultural change. The researchers confirmed that larger beads appeared in southern Africa some 2,000 years ago, when people began to herd sheep and goats, but did not replace existing bead styles. The larger bead size may have been introduced by the people who brought domesticated animals to the region, they explained. In eastern Africa, however, bead styles did not change at the time herding was introduced, although beads made by foragers in eastern Africa were similarly sized to the larger beads made by herders in southern Africa. The researchers conclude that peoples from southern and eastern Africa may have had contact with each other as herding spread, but the experience did not extinguish local traditions. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8276-191209-pompeii-groma-mosaic,Roman,\"Pompeii Mosaic May Depict Surveyors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Tool.

Roman survey technicians, known as gromatici , employed a cross-shaped instrument called a groma . A cord hanging from each of the perpendicular arms of the cross ended with a weight or plumb bob that could be used to create plumb lines. Thus, the tool allowed surveyors to establish true vertical and horizontal lines when planning towns and aqueducts. One groma has been uncovered at Pompeii, but their use has only been known from texts dating to the medieval period. Osanna and his colleagues explained that one of the mosaic images in the House of Orion resembles those seen in a medieval text. It consists of a square inscribed in a circle, which is cut by two perpendicular lines. One of the lines aligns with the longitudinal axis of the structure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s atrium. A second image, made up of a circle inscribed with a cross, appears to depict a groma.

Staudigel suggests that pottery technology, which would have been necessary for boiling the clams in water, may not have been in widespread use. Some of the clams had been exposed to lower levels of heat, he added. They may have been placed on top of clams that had been placed directly over cooking fires. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8274-191209-england-roman-egg,Roman,\"Roman-Era Eggs and Bread Basket Recovered from Watery Pit.

EINDHOVEN, THE NETHERLANDS\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a report in The Guardian , a population study conducted by Krist Vaesen of Eindhoven University of Technology and his colleagues suggests the arrival of modern humans in Europe may not have triggered the demise of Neanderthals some 40,000 years ago. When modern humans arrived in Europe some 60,000 years ago, the Neanderthal population is thought to have numbered between 10,000 and 70,000 individuals. Vaesen said the models explored what might have happened to Neanderthal populations over a period of 10,000 years, factoring in the possible impact of inbreeding; natural fluctuations in birth rates, deaths, and sex ratios; and so-called Allee effects, which hamper the growth of small populations through limited mate choice and a lack of hunters and caregivers. Inbreeding, which harms the fitness of the population, may have been the sole cause of Neanderthal extinction, Vaesen explained, although in one scenario explored by the researchers, modern humans could have contributed to Neanderthal extinction by simply being present in the environment and isolating different Neanderthal groups. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has nothing to do with competition or superiority, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more of a fragmentation of the habitat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8272-191206-roman-lead-levels,Roman,\"Study Suggests Roman Britons Suffered from Toxic Lead Levels.

The level of lead in the bones from Londinium was high enough to have affected the health of urban Romans, Scott explained, and may have even impacted their birth rates through reduced sperm levels, stillbirths, and premature births. Scott suggests Romans were exposed to lead through lead plumbing, though it was not widely used in Roman London, lead drinking vessels, and even through the use of lead acetate as a food sweetener. Critics of the study note that bone can absorb lead and other metals from soil, making it hard to rule out contamination after death. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6335-180208-egypt-tel-edfu,Egyptian,\"4,500-Year-Old Buildings Unearthed in Upper Egypt.

One of the structures still had its rare and expensive wooden door, and the outer fa\\xc3\\xa7ade of the larger one was designed with an unusual slope. The buildings were part of a larger complex of open courtyards, workshops, and storage areas where more than 200 broken clay seals, which were used to mark boxes, containers, and letters, were found. The researchers think areas in the structures might have been used for making beer and bread, and for smelting copper. The buildings may have also housed officials who came from the capital in Memphis to inspect the mining of metals and gems in the surrounding desert. Moeller said the unique finds suggest the city of Edfu may have been becoming more important during the late Fifth Dynasty, perhaps as a departure point for expeditions to the deserts to the east, and maybe even the Red Sea shore, which is about 125 miles to the east. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8228-191205-rome-imported-wood,Roman,\"Tests Suggest Ancient Romans Imported Wood from France.

The empire and its capital city, Nineveh, experienced higher than average levels of rainfall between 850 and 740 B.C., which encouraged the production of plentiful crops and the expansion of the empire. Megadrought conditions between 675 and 550 B.C., however, would have intensified the unrest caused by civil war, overexpansion, and military defeat.

The remains of at least several million Threskiornis aethiopicus , mummified between 600 B.C. and A.D. 250, have been recovered from ancient temples dedicated to Thoth, the ibis-headed god of wisdom. Ibis mummies are thought to have been available for purchase at the temples, where they were put on display as offerings, and then eventually moved into tunnels and storage rooms beneath the temples. The 40 DNA samples in the study were collected from five such catacombs. Wasef and her team members were able to recover mitochondrial genomes from 14 of them, and found that none of these birds were closely related to each other through the maternal line, as they would have been if they had been bred in captivity for generations. She suggests the priests of Thoth captured wild birds or collected their eggs seasonally, then raised the chicks for eventual mummification without trying to breed them.

The analysis was conducted with X-ray and infrared light-based techniques. The mummified bone samples, which range from 2,000 to 4,000 years old, came from the burial ground at Saqqara in northern Egypt, and Aswan, an ancient city located in southern Egypt. Mohamed Kasem of Cairo University said the researchers detected lead, aluminum, and other elements in the bones that they think reflect the toxicity of the ancient Egyptian environment. The aluminum is thought to have come from the potassium alum compound added to drinking water to reduce cloudiness, while the lead in the bones is likely to have come from the lead used to polish pottery.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK\\xe2\\x80\\x94The latest round in an ongoing debate over the age and authorship of ancient cave paintings in Spain now revolves around the reliability of a dating technique called U-Th, according to a report in Science News . U-Th, sometimes known as the U-series method, allows researchers to establish the minimum age of cave paintings by dating mineral deposits that have formed on top of them. These deposits contain trace amounts of uranium, which decays to thorium at a steady rate, so the age of the designs can be calculated from the ratio of the two elements. In 2018, a team led by geochronologist Dirk Hoffmann of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, published a minimum date of more than 64,000 years ago for cave paintings at three separate sites in Spain, arguing that, as modern humans are not believed to have entered the region until about 40,000 years ago, the designs must have been made by Neanderthals. The assertion immediately made waves among scholars of cave art. Criticisms leveled at the paper have included questions over the cognitive capacity of Neanderthals to have produced the artwork, and, now, concerns that water running across cave surfaces could have reduced uranium levels in the mineral deposits, making it appear that the uranium had been decaying longer than it actually has. This would mean the Spanish cave art could be tens of thousands of years more recent, and well within the timeframe of modern humans. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8146-191030-akkadian-dust-storms-collapse,Bronze Age,\"Sandstorms May Have Triggered Akkadian Empire\\'s Fall.

Fermented beverages made from other plants and honey may have been produced locally, however. Rageot and her colleagues also tested seven goblets, beakers, bowls, jugs, and bottles imported from Greece at the end of the period, and noted that by this time, wine drinking appeared to have been restricted to the elites.

Lead-tin yellow was thought to have been first used by European painters in A.D. 1300, while the first use of lead-antimonate yellow was thought to date to A.D. 1600. Other pigments in the ancient Egyptian paint included white calcite and gypsum; synthetic Egyptian blue pigment, invented in the third millennium B.C.; green atacamite; red hematite; and golden yellow orpiment.

Each household was made up of a high-status man married to a high-status women who grew up elsewhere, and unrelated male and female servants who had been buried without grave goods. Research team members Alissa Mittnik of Harvard Medical School and Philipp Stockhammer of Ludwig Maximilian University and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History explained that some of the high-ranking male individuals in the sample carried a variant of the Y chromosome, which is passed from fathers to sons, associated with the Neolithic Bell Beaker culture. The Y chromosome variant carried by these men is still found in Europe today. Men buried without grave goods in the family cemeteries carried a different variant of the Y chromosome. Women who had been buried with elaborate grave goods carried DNA unrelated to others buried in the cemetery. The chemical composition of their teeth and the style of some of their grave goods suggest they grew up in eastern Germany and the Czech Republic. The remains of local girls who had died before reaching adulthood, and poor unrelated women, were also identified in the cemeteries.

The text describes the tomb occupant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming-of-age party as a young man, which featured a banquet for 6,840 people and a gladiator show with more than 400 fighters. Osanna said the guests would have only been adult men who possessed political rights, or about 27 to 30 percent of the population, putting the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total at about 30,000 people around A.D. 59. The inscription also relates how the man sold wheat at discounted prices to Pompeii citizens and distributed free bread during a four-year famine. Osanna thinks this gesture may have been depicted in a now famous Pompeii mosaic showing bread distribution to two men and a child. This citizen was also remembered for successfully speaking to Emperor Nero on behalf of Pompeians who were ejected from the city after a riot during a gladiator show. Based upon the contents of other inscriptions in the city, Osanna thinks the tomb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s occupant may have been Gnaeus Alleius Nigidius Maius, but the area where a name had been carved in the tomb was destroyed by looters in the nineteenth century. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8044-191002-zominthos-palace-throne,Bronze Age,\"Possible Minoan Throne Room Unearthed in Crete.

Denisovans are thought to have first occupied the cave some 287,000 years ago, while Neanderthals are thought to have arrived 140,000 years ago. However, the test results suggest hominins only visited the cave sporadically, if at all. Archaeologist Mike Morley of Flinders University said the amount of fossilized hyena and wolf droppings in the cave suggest non-human carnivores were the cave\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary inhabitants. In addition, the limited evidence for the use of fire in the cave could mean that hominin bones might have been carried into the cave by scavenging hyenas. The study also revealed that the climate in the region changed from a cold and arid open steppe during glacial periods to warmer, wetter forested steppe during interglacial periods. Morley said Neanderthals and Denisovans were probably both well adapted to living in cold weather. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8040-190930-rome-citizenship-veteran,Roman,\"1,700-Year-Old Bronze Document Found in Roman Fortress.

Eustachian tubes are cartilaginous structures connecting the middle ear to the upper throat and the back of the nasal cavity. The team of physical anthropologists and head and neck anatomists found that Neanderthal Eustachian tubes had a flat angle resembling the Eustachian tubes of modern human infants. Middle ear infections are common among young children today because this flat angle is prone to trapping bacteria in the tube. But by the age of five, the tubes lengthen and the angle becomes more acute, allowing the ear to drain. It appears, however, that the lifelong flat angle of Neanderthal Eustachian tubes left the hominins susceptible to ear infections and complications such as respiratory infections, hearing loss, pneumonia, and chronic health problems that could have made it difficult to compete for survival. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8034-190926-england-roman-fort,Roman,\"Roman Fort Found in Southwest England.

The Tripolye culture, also known as the Cucuteni-Tripyllia culture, occupied the area from the Carpathian Mountains to the Dnieper River from about 4100 to 3600 B.C. The rectangular building, made of clay-covered split wood and logs, had a roofed-off section with a fireplace, a walled courtyard, and was one of 3,000 individual homes arranged in concentric rings at Maidanetske, although the researchers, led by Robert Hofmann of Christian-Albrechts University, are not sure how many of the structures existed at the same time. Other prehistoric megastructures measuring up to 18,000 square feet have been found in Eastern Europe through geophysical surveys, but without excavation, researchers did not know how such structures were used.

MANNHEIM, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a report in The Times of Israel , an international team of scientists led by Daniel Berger of the Curt Engelhorn Center for Archaeometry and his retired colleague Ernst Pernicka analyzed the composition of tin ingots recovered from five Late Bronze Age underwater archaeological sites in the eastern Mediterranean in order to trace their origins. It had been previously thought that the tin used in bronze production in the Levant in the second millennium B.C. was imported from central Asia, since very little raw tin exists in the region. Comparison of the composition of the various samples revealed, however, that tin ingots found at three sites off the coast of Haifa, Israel, are likely to have been mined in southwest England, in what are now the areas of Cornwall and Devon. Tin from mines in Anatolia, central Asia, and Egypt was ruled out as a source for these samples because it was formed either much earlier or later. The researchers suggest that amber, glass, and copper were probably also traded along complex routes connecting Europe and the eastern Mediterranean much earlier than had been believed. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8009-190916-china-painted-tomb,East Asia,\"1,000-Year-Old Painted Tomb Uncovered in China.

Pierattini attempted to move similarly grooved stone blocks with a simple lifting machine, and found that the grooves could have allowed ancient builders to lift blocks weighing between about 400 and 900 pounds, and position them with the assistance of metal levers. The machine would have been in use for about 150 years, he added, until the invention of the crane\\xe2\\x80\\x94which moves heavy objects using hoists and winches\\xe2\\x80\\x94some 2,500 years ago. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7813-190710-cambodia-statue-fragment,South&Southeast Asia,\"Statue Fragment Unearthed in Siem Reap.

The giant, carved stone jars are thought to have been used in burial rituals some 2,500 years ago. Researchers have suggested that bodies may have been stored in the jars until the bones could be cleaned and buried. Archaeologist Louise Shewan of Monash University said the newly mapped jars indicate that such burial practices may have been more widespread than previously thought. The jars were probably carved in quarries and transported to the forested mountain sites, said Shewan\\'s codirector on the project, Dougald O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Reilly of Australian National University. Near the jars, the researchers uncovered stone disks carved with images of animals and geometric designs buried with the carved side face down.

Botanists Susanne Renner of the University of Munich and Guillaume Chomicki of the University of Oxford analyzed a tiny piece of one of the ancient watermelon leaves that were discovered in an Egyptian tomb and sent to botanist Joseph Hooker in London in the late nineteenth century. Fortunately, the partial genome sequence the researchers obtained from the artifact contained genes related to color and taste. This melon plant did not produce the bitter cucurbitacins found in Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wild, round watermelons. It also lacked a functioning gene for transforming the red pigment lycopene into another substance, which means the plant produced fruit with red flesh. Ancient Egyptian images of watermelons depict them with an elongated shape, but the partial gene sequence did not reveal the contours of this particular plant\\'s fruit. Renner said the analysis also suggests the plant was related to sweet watermelons with white flesh that are grown to this day in Sudan. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7666-190520-egypt-meteor-glass,Egyptian,\"New Thoughts on the Origins of King Tut\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Yellow Scarab.

Aaron Cavosie of Curtin University led a team of researchers who analyzed grains of the mineral zircon found in similar pieces of glass recovered in the Libyan desert. It had been previously suggested that such yellow glass could have been formed by the heat and pressure created by an asteroid that exploded near the Earth, in an event known as an airburst. But Cavosie and his colleagues detected evidence that the zircon in the glass samples had transformed from reidite, a mineral only formed under pressure so intense it must have been triggered by an actual meteor impact. Cavosie explained that although airbursts happen more frequently than meteor impacts, they do not cause as much damage. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7659-190516-florida-underwater-burials,Native American,\"New Dates for Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ancient, Underwater Burial Site.

The scientists suggest plant matter may have been ground and prepared for use in the snuffing tablets and inhaled with the tube.

KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Science Magazine reports that inscriptions written in Cherokee script have been discovered at the head of an underground stream in Alabama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manitou Cave. Made up of 85 characters based on the syllables of the Cherokee language, the syllabary used in the inscriptions was invented in the early nineteenth century by Sequoyah, a Cherokee silversmith. It was officially adopted by the Cherokee Nation in 1825, and was widely used to communicate in daily life and in print. Jan Simek of the University of Tennessee, along with scholars from the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees, and the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, as well as additional colleagues worked together to understand the cave\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inscriptions. They concluded that the text commemorated a sacred game similar to the modern game of lacrosse played on April 30, 1828. The rituals conducted before the game are thought to have been presided over by Sequoyah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s son, Richard Guess, whose name appears in an adjoining inscription. A third inscription, reading \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am your grandson,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was found written backwards on the ceiling of the cave and is thought to have been a message for Cherokee ancestors and other supernatural beings.

Moreover, the presence of chromium on a weapon did not correlate with how well it was preserved. Chromium was found most often at the point where the blade would have met a wooden haft or handle, and was only rarely found on the blade of a sword or the point of an arrow. Martin\\xc3\\xb3n-Torres and his colleagues think chromium may have been applied to the wooden parts of weapons, and that any chromium that they detected on the metal parts of weapons was probably contamination from treated wood that had rotten away.

It had been previously thought that the Hyksos rulers of Egypt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 15th\\xc2\\xa0Dynasty took power by force. Biological anthropologist Christina Stantis of Bournemouth University and her colleagues analyzed strontium isotopes in the teeth of 71 individuals whose remains were unearthed at Tell el-Dab\\xe2\\x80\\x99a, the site of the Hyksos capital in the Nile Delta. About half of the remains in the sample dated to hundreds of years before Hyksos rule, while the rest dated to the period of the Hyksos dynasty. The strontium levels indicate that most of the women buried in elite graves shortly before the Hyksos came to power grew up eating plants and animals raised outside the Nile Valley. By contrast, all but a few of the elite males from this time period were found to have grown up locally. Stantis suggests the nonlocal women were Hyksos women who may have married into Egyptian royal families after moving to the Nile Delta. The study also suggests that about half of the men and women buried in the cemetery during the period of Hyksos rule came to Tell el-Dab\\xe2\\x80\\x99a from elsewhere.

Previous analysis of isotopes obtained from the Bronze Age remains indicated that the Egtved Girl may have grown up in southern Germany, and traveled between Denmark and another location in the last years of her life, before she died in Denmark. Skrydstrup Woman was also thought to have arrived in Denmark as a teenager. But Andreasen grew concerned that the maps of strontium distributions on which these conclusions were based did not reflect conditions prior to the introduction of modern farming techniques. After adjusting for the presence of agricultural lime, Andreasen and his team members say the data suggests the women may have actually spent their lives within about six miles of where they were buried. The researchers behind the original studies are unconvinced, however. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOverall, there is nothing in the study from Aarhus which changes our interpretation: That the two women from the Bronze Age came from afar,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Karin Frei, a professor of archaeometry at the National Museum of Denmark, and Robert Frei, a professor of geology and geochemistry at the University of Copenhagen. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7474-190314-ireland-bog-butter,Bronze Age,\"New Dates for Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \"\"Bog Butters\"\". DUBLIN, IRELAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Journal reports that a new study of Ireland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \"\"bog butter\"\" has been conducted by Richard Evershed of the University of Bristol, Jessica Smyth of University College Dublin, and their colleagues. They dated 32 bog butters held at the National Museum of Ireland, and analyzed samples of the fats to determine whether they were actually milk fats or fats from animal carcasses. The results of the tests indicate that the waxy substances are indeed degraded butter, and push back the origin of the practice of storing butter in bogs by some 1,500 years. In fact, five of the samples date to the Bronze Age. The oldest sample, which dates to around 1700 B.C., is thought to have been wrapped in bark. Smyth said the dairy products may have simply been stored in the cool, low-oxygen, high-acid environment of bogs in order to preserve them for future consumption, or they may have been offerings, just as gold, axes, and other bladed weapons were deposited in bogs during the Bronze Age. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7471-190314-israel-negev-elusa,Near East,\"Inscription Identifies Ancient City in Negev Desert.

Geoscientist Dan Penny of the University of Sydney and his colleagues found that evidence of burning, forest disturbances, and soil erosion in the form of traces of plants, pollen, and minerals in the sediment cores decreased throughout the fourteenth century. At the same time, pollen from floating vegetation in the moat increased, indicating that the moat was not being maintained as it once had been. The rest of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extensive water system may have also failed for lack of repairs, Penny said.

Fecal stanols are produced in the human gut during digestion and are eliminated from the body as waste. Archaeological evidence suggests the population of Cahokia grew between A.D. 600 and 1100, was in decline by 1200, and that the city had been abandoned by 1400. The team, which also included AJ White of California State University, suggests that when the ancient city\\'s population was higher, more human waste would be expected to have washed into Horseshoe Lake, leaving behind higher levels of stanols. Schroeder said the concentration of fecal stanols in the different layers of the sediment cores did rise and fall over time in accord with previous population estimates. The researchers tied their population study to an earlier one that found evidence of significant Mississippi River flooding around A.D. 1150, and they looked for additional evidence of changing climate conditions in the form of different levels of oxygen isotopes in the sediment cores. They found a likely drop in summer rainfall, which was necessary for farming, at about the time Cahokia began to decline. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7432-190225-peru-inca-baths,Pre-Columbian,\"Inca Ritual Baths Studied in Peru.

This is based upon his study of stone artifacts from the site of the Uruujitokyu ruins in Itoshima, the Nakabaru ruins in Karatsu, and the Higashi Oda Mine ruins in Chikuzen. It had been previously thought that writing emerged in Japan around the third century A.D., based upon the discovery of pottery decorated with written characters. Ink stones, which are generally thin, flat, fan-shaped, and polished on one side, are thought to have originated in China in the third century B.C. Ink stones dating to the first century have been previously unearthed in southwestern Japan, but they were believed to have been imported. Some of the possible ink stones recently identified by Yanagida had been broken before they were completed. Artifacts from the sites also include unfinished stone files for making ink from the ink stones, and stone saws. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere was a demand for the written word,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Yanagida explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why [the ink stones] were being made.

The Caucasus region stretches from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, and includes part or all of what is now Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Iran, and Turkey. Wolfgang Haak of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History suggested that Bronze Age farmers living in the southern Caucasus likely spread north over the mountains, where they met nomads from the Eurasian steppe, some of whom were related to Yamnaya groups to the northwest. Other steppe-dwellers, such as the Steppe Maykop, had genes resembling those found in Paleolithic Siberians, ancient Native Americans, and modern North Asians, he said. Some of these groups met in an interaction zone, where they were likely to have exchanged genes along with cultural, technological, and social innovations such as effective metal weapons, the wheel, and the wagon. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7346-190204-egypt-minya-tombs,Egyptian,\"Tombs and Mummies Discovered in Southern Egypt.

A head with similar features was found at Devni Mori, a site about 40 miles to the east.

The excavators first discovered the entrance to a tunnel carved out of rock in an area of the site surrounded by temples, pyramids, and palaces. The tunnel leads to a set of stairs, and then a second tunnel, which ends in a rectangular room with rock-cut benches. An oval hearth in the wall opposite the entrance to the room is thought to have been used to heat large stones. Water would then have been poured over them to create steam. Koszkul and \\xc5\\xb9ra\\xc5\\x82ka suggest the excess water would have flowed into a hollow in the middle of the bath\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rock floor, and out of the structure through a drain channel in the tunnels. The researchers also found pottery and obsidian tools in the tunnels, which may have been used during rituals held in the steam bath. The structure was completely sealed with mortar and rubble around 300 B.C., Koszkul said, perhaps as result of social and religious changes in Maya society. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7289-190109-india-harappan-burial,South&Southeast Asia,\"Unusual Joint Grave Found Near Ancient City in India.

The third statue resembles the other two in style and is also thought to have been carved by Gyokai, even though it was not signed.

Three of the men with the growths were buried together. The growths, known as external auditory exostoses, or surfers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ear, are thought to form as a reaction to long exposure to cold wind and water. And although Panama is a tropical country, water temperatures in the Gulf of Panama drop between January and April, when trade winds from the north blow warm surface water out into the Pacific Ocean, and colder water rises to the surface. Smith-Guzm\\xc3\\xa1n suggested the growths could indicate that early Panamanians spent a lot of time in deep waters to retrieve thorny oysters, giant conch, and pearl oysters, rather than the occurrence of fungal or bacterial infections, since the condition appeared mostly in males. If the growths had been caused by illness, they would have appeared in both men and women at about the same rate, she reasoned. Further research will compare ancient and modern examples of surfers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ear across the region, Smith-Guzm\\xc3\\xa1n added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7280-190104-china-han-dynasty-tombs,East Asia,\"Pottery Figurines Discovered in Han Dynasty Tomb.

Shotoku Taishi, who lived from A.D. 574 to 622, fought on the side of the Soga clan. He built the famed Buddhist Horyuji temple in 607.

HIGHLAND PARK, TEXAS\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Cosmos Magazine reports that Jenna Battillo of Southwestern Methodist University says that consuming a fungus that grows on corn allowed the ancestral Puebloans to survive on a corn-based diet beginning around 400 B.C. and lasting for a period of about 800 years. Corn is thought to have comprised about 80 percent of the calories consumed by the people of the Basketmaker II culture, who also ate a small amount of wild plants, and occasionally some wild rabbit, but not enough to make up for the lack of essential nutrients in their staple crop. Yet, analysis of human remains from the period have not detected signs of pellagra, a potentially fatal disease that can be caused by the lack of vitamins and amino acids in a corn-based diet. Now considered a delicacy, corn fungus, or Ustilago maydis , alters the nutritional content of corn, increasing its protein levels and boosting the levels of most of the missing amino acids. Battillo suggests the ancient practice of boiling corn with limestone, and the small amount of food consumed from other sources, may have provided enough of the key missing amino acid to keep the ancestral Puebloans healthy. The levels of corn fungus spores in the human feces found at Turkey Pen Ruin, an ancestral Pueblo site in Utah, suggests the corn fungus may have been eaten intentionally, she added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6794-180717-japan-pottery-fishing,East Asia,\"Fishing May Have Driven Use of Pottery in Ancient Japan.

The Israel Antiquities Authority announced that the writing was spotted by researcher Oren Ableman of Hebrew University on fragments of scrolls that had been recovered from Cave 11, and appeared to be blank. Using infrared imaging, Ableman discovered Hebrew letters and words on the fragments. He was able to determine that some of the scraps had fallen from the scrolls of Deuteronomy and Leviticus, two books from the Hebrew Bible, and from the Book of Jubilees, which was written during the same period. Of the many fragments in the collection, one is thought to be from an unknown third copy of the Temple Scroll; a piece of Psalm 147:1 from the Great Psalms Scroll which suggests the ancient version of the Psalm is slightly shorter than the modern one; and a fragment bearing letters written in paleo-Hebrew that could belong to an unknown manuscript. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6559-180420vietnam-imperial-citadel,South&Southeast Asia,\"Dragon Tiles Recovered in Vietnam.

They found the Negev birds were much smaller than those known to have been bred for their meat. And, the farmers placed their dovecotes in the middle of agricultural fields, usually about one-half mile away from their own homes, which also suggests the birds were not consumed. The scientists estimate the 1,200 to 1,600 birds living in one of the dovecotes could have produced as much as 12 to 15 tons of guano per year that could be used to nourish grapes, olives, and other crops. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6461-180322-new-jersey-native-american,Native American,\"Prehistoric Native American Sites Excavated in New Jersey.

The structure measures about 60 feet long and 60 feet wide, with a watchtower placed at each of its four corners. A carved rock weighing more than three tons served as the threshold at the entrance to the fortress. The entrance opened into a courtyard paved with stone slabs and central columns. Rooms on either side of the structure contained hundreds of pieces of pottery, including a bowl and cup that may have been reserved for ritual use. Ganor and Weissbein said that once the Egyptians left the region, the unprotected Canaanite cities fell, probably at the hands of the Philistines. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8999-200903-raphael-egyptian-blue,Medieval,\"Ancient Hue Detected in Renaissance Painting.

Built on an island in a lake by nomadic Uyghurs, it had been thought that the complex was constructed in A.D. 750, during the reign of Bayan-Chur Khan, based on a runic inscription describing the construction of a large monument. Crafted with 40-foot-tall clay walls set on wood foundations, Por-Bajin measures 705 feet long by 530 feet wide. And although previous research suggests the complex was built over a short time period, it appears that it was never used. The new research revised the date of the construction of Por-Bajin to A.D. 777, during the reign of Tengri B\\xc3\\xb6g\\xc3\\xbc Khan, who had converted to the religion of Manichaeism. He was killed in an anti-Manichaean rebellion in 779. The new timeline suggests the Khan could have built the complex as a Manichaeism monastery that was no longer needed after his death. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/9042-200921-denmark-torstenson-war,Medieval,\"Shipwreck from 17th-Century War Found Near Denmark.

Wim Van Neer of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and Savino di Lernia of Sapienza University of Rome said up to 90 percent of the animal bones in the cave\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 10,000-year-old layers came from fish such as catfish and tilapia. Some 5,000 years later, fish accounted for only about 48 percent of the animal bones found in the rock shelter. Overall, the remains of birds and shellfish made up almost 20 percent of the food waste. The researchers suggest that the number of fish bones decreased as the number of mammal bones increased, reflecting an increasing reliance on hunting and herding, perhaps because the region was becoming more arid.

Much of the church structure and seventeenth-century features are thought to have been destroyed when the housing development was constructed in the 1960s, he added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8211-191127-great-auk-extinction,Paleolithic,\"Did Human Hunters Alone Wipe Out the Great Auk?. SWANSEA, WALES\\xe2\\x80\\x94Human hunters alone could be responsible for the rapid extinction of the great auk, according to an eLife announcement. Jessica Thomas of Swansea University said millions of the large, flightless birds, prized for their meat, eggs, and feathers, once lived along the east coast of North America, off the coasts of Iceland and Scotland, and throughout Scandinavia. Thomas and her colleagues analyzed mitochondrial genetic data obtained from the remains of 41 great auks, ocean current data, and the probability of auk populations going extinct within a certain amount of time in order to reconstruct bird populations over the past 11,700 years. The study results indicate that the industrial-scale pressure humans put on bird populations beginning in the early sixteenth century were probably enough to wipe them out, even if environmental changes did not put them at risk. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8210-191127-norway-ship-burial,Medieval,\"1,000-Year-Old Ship Burial Found in Norway.

The original burial dates to the eighth century A.D. and consists of a boat measuring nearly 32 feet long, in which the remains of a man and weapons were found. Some 100 years later, this burial was carefully excavated, and the remains of a woman\\xc2\\xa0were placed in a boat measuring about 26 feet long, which was then carefully fitted into the older, larger vessel. Buried with the woman were two large shell-shaped brooches made of gilded bronze, a crucifix-shaped brooch made from an Irish harness fitting, a pearl necklace, two scissors, a spindle whorl, and a cow head.

OLD ABERDEEN, SCOTLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Evening Express reports that 115 human bone fragments recovered from a private garden in northeastern Scotland by archaeologist Alison Cameron may have been buried by medical student Alexander Creyk and his roommates, who lived on the property in the early nineteenth century. Rebecca Crozier of the University of Aberdeen said the bones came from five to seven people, two of whom were children between the ages of two and seven. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn the case of the child, we were able to tell that a hole had been drilled into the skull and I was able to match it to a particular tool,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Crozier said. A similar hole was found in the skull of an adult. In both cases, the procedure occurred after the person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death. Carbon dating indicates the bones belonged to people who lived between 1650 and 1750. The Anatomy Act, passed in the United Kingdom in 1832, was intended to halt grave robbing and the illegal trade in corpses by regulating the study of donated human bodies. Aberdeenshire Council archaeologist Bruce Mann said Creyk and his colleagues may have buried the remains on the property to avoid legal troubles. The bones will be reburied in a cemetery close to where they were found, he added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8125-191022-rosemarkie-man-genome,Medieval,\"Genetic Analysis Links Scottish Highland Skeleton to Orkney.

Coins uncovered at the site suggest the drove road that passed the pub had been in use since the late sixteenth century.

An inverted cross found on a hearth stone may have been intended to keep witches from flying down the chimney, Bailie added.

JENA, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94An international team of researchers led by Mark Hudson of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History suggests that fish may have been raised for food in China as early as 6200 B.C. The scientists analyzed and compared carp teeth unearthed at Jiahu, a Neolithic site in central China, with remains of fish unearthed at other archaeological sites, and fish raised in modern fish farms in Japan. In earlier periods at Jiahu, when fish were caught in the wild during the spawning season, the catch consisted of adult fish, the researchers explained, but beginning around 6200 B.C., both mature and immature fish were processed at the site. Hudson and his colleagues think the early farmers began to keep some of the wild-caught carp alive in confined spaces, such as rice paddy fields, where they continued to spawn. When the water was drained, both the mature and immature fish were harvested. The high proportion of bones at Jiahu from a type of carp found less commonly in the wild is also evidence for the practice of aquaculture, the researchers added, indicating that the fish farmers kept their preferred variety. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8050-191003-russia-black-death,Medieval,\"Black Death Bacteria May Have Originated in Russia.

Richie and his colleagues recorded the ruins with laser scanners and built 3-D digital models of the sites. The buildings, which were both associated with large corn drying kilns, were constructed on farms close to water sources and not far from Glasgow markets, he explained. The 1788 Excise Act banned the use of stills producing less than 100 gallons of whiskey at a time, but legal whiskey was often of poor quality, since the large distilleries tended to use raw unmalted grain in order to avoid paying the heavy tax imposed on malted grain. Ritchie said grain could have been malted in the remote corn drying kilns, fermented and distilled in the long narrow buildings, and smuggled southward where it would have sold for a higher price than the inferior legal product. Both farms were abandoned in the 1840s, he added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/8043-191002-london-boar-s-head,Medieval,\"Elizabethan-Era Theater Site Excavated in London.

Based on this finding, the researchers suggest the burial represents an expression of commitment between the pair. While they cannot rule out a romantic relationship between the men, they noted that negative attitudes toward same-sex relationships in Late Antique Italy, as well as Christian religious restrictions in place at the time, make it unlikely those responsible for their burial positioning would have intentionally depicted such a connection. Other skeletons interred in the same cemetery show evidence of injury, perhaps indicating the necropolis was a war cemetery.

One of the genomes was obtained from the jawbone of a young female Neanderthal, discovered in Belgium\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Scladina Cave in 1993, and the other was extracted from the femur of a male Neanderthal found in Germany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hohlenstein-Stadel Cave in 1937. The study suggests these two individuals were closely related to Neanderthals who lived in Western Europe just 40,000 years ago, around when the species is thought to have died out. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA from the male Neanderthal also revealed more than 70 mutations not found in later Neanderthal individuals.

The pottery fragments ranged in age from 8,000 to 7,000 years old, and came from vessels that had small mouths, thin necks, and wide sides that blocked fresh air and promoted the brewing process. At the site of Lingkou, Liu said, the early farmers began the fermentation process by allowing grains to sprout, which freed up their natural sugars for fermentation. Meanwhile, at the site of Guantaoyuan, fungi, herbs, and grains were added to cereals as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfermentation starter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d known as q\\xc5\\xab.

MADRID, SPAIN\\xe2\\x80\\x94It had been previously thought that the practice of herding domesticated animals may have spread across Africa through exchange networks, but Science News reports that a new genetic study of human remains unearthed in East Africa tells a different story. The researchers found that early herders, who were related to Middle Eastern pastoralists, first mixed with foragers in northeast Africa between 6,000 and 5,000 years ago. They then traveled south to the Rift Valley, where they mated with foragers there between 4,500 and 3,500 years ago. Mary Prendergast of Saint Louis University and her colleagues say that after this time, herders and foragers living in East Africa remained isolated from each other, although the herders spread rapidly throughout the region. Then, some 1,200 years ago, the study suggests that additional groups of people from northeastern and western Africa migrated into East Africa, where they produced another genetic shift that paralleled the rise of farming and ironworking. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7695-190604-bulgaria-sofia-tomb,Roman,\"Ancient Tomb Unearthed in Bulgaria.

Paleoanthropologist Aida G\\xc3\\xb3mez-Robles of University College London calculated the rate of changes in tooth shape for eight ancient hominid species, and then examined 430,000-year-old Neanderthal teeth recovered from Sima de los Huesos, a site in Spain. Based upon the steady rate of change of tooth crowns in the other hominid species, she determined that the distinctive shape of the Neanderthal teeth began forming between 800,000 and 1.2 million years ago. Analysis of Neanderthal DNA has suggested the last common ancestor of the two species lived between 550,000 and 765,000 years ago, but researchers do not agree on the speed of genetic mutations, or how consistent that change may have been over time. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7658-190516-greece-mytilene-nemesis,Roman,\"Altar Dedicated to Nemesis Uncovered in Mytilene.

Over decades, the repeated passage of carts on the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stone-paved streets eroded away ruts and holes that made travel difficult. The researchers said complete repaving of the streets would have been difficult and expensive, and would have blocked important routes through the city for months at a time. Molten iron, however, when poured, would have filled the holes and ruts and hardened into a smooth surface. Stone and ground-up pieces of terracotta may also have been placed in the holes. Poehler explained that the small amounts of iron that team members identified on the streets may have been spilled as slaves carried molten iron from furnaces to ruts and holes in need of repair. The researchers plan to analyze the chemical composition of the iron next, in order to determine where it was mined. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7653-190514-poland-neolithic-burial,Neolithic,\"Four Families Detected in Late Neolithic Burial in Poland.

The core was one of three removed when archaeologists found cracks in one of the vertical stones while raising a fallen trilithon, and inserted metal rods in it to stabilize the set of two upright stones topped by a third resting horizontally across them. Robert Phillips, who worked for a diamond-cutting firm at the time, was one of the team members who reinforced the cracked sarsen stone. He kept one of the cores in a plastic tube displayed in his office in England, and then, after he retired, in his home in Florida. Phillips recently decided to return the stone core to England. David Nash of Brighton University and his colleagues have been analyzing the geochemical fingerprint of the sarsen stones at Stonehenge with a hand-held portable spectrometer, a non-destructive technique. The recently returned core comes from the interior of a sarsen stone, and so offers Nash and his team an unweathered sample. Nash said it had been previously thought that all of the sarsen stones came from nearby Marlborough Downs, but initial test results indicate it is possible they came from multiple locations. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7633-190506-roman-england-vindolanda,Roman,\"Roman Game Board Unearthed at Vindolanda.

Their reddish color may have resulted from exposure to cinnabar, another prized material, Odriozola explained. He and his colleagues speculate that real amber beads may have been difficult to acquire, even for high-status individuals such as those buried in these two tombs, or these individuals may not have been as wealthy as once thought, and settled for lower cost, look-alike jewelry. A third possibility, according to the researchers, is that the fake amber beads were peddled by unscrupulous traders.

Researchers were not able to recover DNA from the jawbone fossil, which is estimated to be at least 160,000 years old, but molecular anthropologist Frido Welker of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the University of Copenhagen said researchers were able to extract collagen proteins from dentine preserved in the jaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s two very large molars. Analysis of these highly degraded proteins suggests the individual was closely related to Denisovans who lived in the Altai Mountains. And, because one of the teeth was still erupting from the jaw, scientists think the individual was an adolescent at the time of death. Some modern Tibetans carry a gene variant that allows them to live at high altitudes. Welker explained that Denisovans living on the Tibetan Plateau may have developed this adaptation and passed it on to modern humans some 30,000 to 40,000 years ago. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7623-190501-england-paget-s-disease,Medieval,\"Rare Bone Disease Detected in Medieval Skeletons.

The site was home to a large community of escaped slaves known as Maroons, who joined the British military in exchange for their freedom. They lived in the fort, which housed some 300 barrels of British gunpowder, on a bluff overlooking the Apalachicola River, with members of the Seminole, Creek, Miccosukee, and Choctaw tribes. Historian Dale Cox said historic records show the people who lived in the community were skilled masons, woodworkers, and farmers who grew melon and squash in fields near the fort. U.S. soldiers traveling the Apalachicola River on July 27, 1816, took one shot at the fort\\xe2\\x80\\x99s powder magazine. It exploded, killing 270 people. Many of the Maroons who survived the blast were captured and re-enslaved.

The researchers found that the hearths did not appear to have been raked out regularly, as they would have been if they had been used frequently, and they lacked burned refuse, food residues, and bone, which are usually recovered from heavily used hearths. In fact, the analysis suggests plant life was able to grow in the burned areas and herbivores were able to graze there between fires. And charred pine cones, which do not grow locally, indicate the Neanderthals may have brought their own fuel with them when they visited. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7612-190425-amazon-hunter-gatherers,Paleolithic,\"Artifacts Push Back Possible Settlement of Amazonia.

The calcium carbonate in the shells fossilized the human bones, which would have otherwise decomposed in the acidic soil, Capriles explained. He thinks the burials may have marked the claim of a group of hunter-gatherers to seasonal wetlands as the climate became drier between 8,000 and 5,500 years ago. He also noted that the people who lived in these camps may have planted sweet potatoes, cassava, peanuts, and chili peppers as they depleted local resources. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7608-190424-pictish-defensive-wall,Medieval,\"Section of Pictish Fort Uncovered in Scotland.

The burial pit, located near the ruin of a Crusader castle in Sidon, contained the burned remains at least 25 individuals. The bones bear evidence of violent injuries and have been radiocarbon dated to the Crusader period, between A.D. 1025 and 1283. A thirteenth-century Crusader coin from Italy, and five buckles with designs typical of medieval Europe, were also recovered from the pit. Of the nine individuals whose remains were analyzed, three are thought to have come from Western Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps Spain and Sardinia. Four of the individuals were eastern Mediterranean locals, and were probably recruited to fight in the religious wars by Crusaders from Western Europe.

The scientists analyzed soil samples from trash heaps, bricks, and hearths from different layers of the site, and found that between 10,000 and 9,700 years ago, the salt concentrations rose dramatically. This possible increase in urine output corresponds with archaeological evidence suggesting that the hunter-gatherers began to keep sheep and goats, but it appears that the shift toward herding may have occurred more rapidly than had been previously thought. Over a period of about 1,000 years, the researchers estimate that on average, some 1,800 people and animals lived at the settlement.

The researchers investigated possible relationships among 18 men and six women buried in four megalithic tombs in Scotland, Ireland, and Sweden between 4500 and 3000 B.C. Analysis of nuclear DNA samples obtained from the remains suggests there were close kinship ties among the men buried at the Scottish site and among those buried at the Swedish site. In addition, at least six of the nine men buried in the Primrose Grange tomb, on the northwest coast of Ireland, may have descended from the same paternal line over as many as 12 generations. One of these men may also have been the father of a man whose remains were found in another megalithic tomb about a mile away. Critics of the study note the small number of individuals in the test sample, the fact that women received identical high-status burials when interred in megalithic tombs, and a separate genetic study that found a lack of close kinship ties among individuals buried at another megalithic tomb in Ireland. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7589-190416-arkansas-patent-medicine,Modern,\"Patent Medicine Bottles and Specimen Jars Found in Arkansas.

An excavation carried out by Cultural Resources Analysts found that the back of a lot owned by the Historic Salisbury Foundation was likely part of a portico to a cotton mill that served as a barracks for the prison. Timothy Roberts, who led the excavation, said a dense concentration of brick, mortar, and granite appears to indicate a corner or edge of the structure. Some of the material from the building, in particular brick, is thought to have been used in buildings that still stand nearby. The portico is known to have existed from drawings of the mill building and prison site, including those sketched by Union prisoner Robert Knox Sneden. When it was built, the prison was estimated to have a capacity of 2,500 prisoners, but by 1864 it held as many as 10,000, leading to disease, starvation, and uprisings that were put down ruthlessly. Almost all the captives were released in February 1865 as part of a prisoner exchange program, and Union forces burned the prison down in April 1865, at the end of the war. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7511-190328-switzerland-toddler-boot,Medieval,\"Medieval Toddler Boot Found in Switzerland.

Fossil specimens of thick P. robustus molars are often found in poor condition. The creature is thought to have lived on a diet of tropical grasses, hard seeds and nuts, and fibrous fruits, but scientists had not been able to determine whether the rough diet could have caused the pitting of tooth enamel and weakened the teeth so that they would have worn down more quickly and perhaps broken more easily. The new study compared P. robustus teeth with the teeth of other hominins and living apes, and found the pitting occurred in 47 percent of P. robustus baby teeth and 14 percent of their permanent teeth, but in only seven percent of the baby teeth of other hominins, and four percent of their adult teeth. The researchers note the similarity of the condition to a rare genetic disorder known as amelogenesis imperfecta, which can damage cells that produce enamel, but is also associated with production of thick, dense enamel. Towle and his colleagues concluded that the more frequent occurrence of pitting may have been a side effect of the evolution of teeth strong enough to cope with the tough, gritty diet consumed by P. robustus . \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7460-190308-lincoln-water-tank,Modern,\"World War II\\xe2\\x80\\x93Era Water Tank Filled In at Lincoln Cathedral.

Whalers from America, Great Britain, France, and colonial Australia stopped at the islands\\xe2\\x80\\x94sometimes for months at a time\\xe2\\x80\\x94while hunting sperm whales and migrating humpback whales. One engraving, on Rosemary Island, was dated 1841 by a sailor on a ship named Connecticut who carved over an indigenous grid pattern on the rock. Paterson said a second indigenous grid was later inscribed over the whaler\\xe2\\x80\\x99s carving. Because some areas of the rocks were still smooth and would have served as better engraving surfaces, Paterson suggests the whalers chose the locations for their carving deliberately, although he does not know what their rationale was. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7448-190304-scotland-edinburgh-docks,Modern,\"Nineteenth-Century Docks Unearthed in Scotland.

Tuck notes, however, that he was not able to find evidence of many of those who escaped the eruption, since foreigners, migrants, and slaves living in Pompeii and Herculaneum at the time of the disaster did not have recorded family names. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7433-190226-neanderthal-pelvis-spine,Pre-Human,\"Reconstruction Suggests Neanderthals Had Balanced Posture. ZURICH, SWITZERLAND\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Cosmos report, a new evaluation of the Neanderthal remains known as La Chapelle-aux-Saint 1 suggests Neanderthals had spines resembling those of modern humans. La Chapelle-aux-Saint 1, discovered in central France in 1908, is an almost complete skeleton of an individual thought to have died some 60,000 years ago around the age of 40. He had lost many of his teeth and suffered from arthritis. Scholars originally suggested this man walked with an ape-like hunched posture and bent knees, and recent studies have suggested Neanderthals may not have had a well-developed curve in their spines. Now, Martin H\\xc3\\xa4usler of the University of Zurich and his colleagues have created a virtual reconstruction from high-resolution 3-D surface scans of the specimen\\'s vertebrae and a cast of his right hip bone, the original of which was misplaced in the 1970s. They found the angle of the pelvis and the way the vertebrae stacked produced an S-shaped spine that curved at the neck and inwards from the lower back toward the waist, much like that of modern humans. H\\xc3\\xa4usler added that the wear on the hip joint was similar in both species. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are quite confident that this is the real shape,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7431-190225-nova-scotia-chamber,Modern,\"Mysterious Underground Chamber Opened in Nova Scotia.

Pitulko said the small settlement on what is now Zhokhov Island was inhabited by 25 to 50 people of the paleo-Arctic Sumnagin cultural complex, who hunted, fished, and lived in reindeer-skin tents. The small number of volcanic glass tools, found among some 19,000 stone tools and other objects made of antler, mammoth ivory, and bone, have been dated to between 8,000 and 9,000 years ago, when sea levels were lower and the island was still connected to mainland Siberia. Chemical analysis of the obsidian indicates it came from the Lake Krasnoye region, more than 1,000 miles away from the site. Pitulko and his colleagues suggest the obsidian could have been carried by traders traveling by dogsled, since traces of wooden sleds, and the remains of dogs who would have weighed around 55 pounds\\xe2\\x80\\x94the size of dog used to pull sleds today because they have sufficient strength but are not so large that they overheat\\xe2\\x80\\x94have also been recovered on the island. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7428-190222-paleolithic-poland-obsidian,Paleolithic,\"Obsidian Trade in Poland Dates Back At Least 20,000 Years.

Among the recently discovered fossils, which are estimated to be between 4.8 and 4.3 million years old, Scott Simpson of Case Western Reserve University and his colleagues found the bones of an individual equipped with ankle bones that may have provided better support for its legs and trunk than Ardi is thought to have enjoyed. This hominin found at Gona also had a big toe that would have propelled its stride, Simpson explained. All of the A. ramidus individuals, however, are only thought to have been able to walk slowly over short distances. They also shared traits such as skeletal features that made them capable tree climbers, flat feet, and grasping, opposable toes. Simpson and his colleagues suggest the possible improvements in walking ability seen in the A. ramidus fossils could link them to the evolution of Australopithecus species, and the earliest known evidence of a human-like gait, some 4.2 million years ago. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7424-190221-sweden-woman-warrior,Medieval,\"Scientists Revisit Woman Warrior\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Remains.

The wood-lined tomb was discovered in the late nineteenth century at Birka, a medieval hill fort settlement, next to other graves containing weapons.

Charcoal discovered between the slabs of rock was radiocarbon dated to the fourth millennium B.C. Wedge-shaped stone tools made of imported mudstone or sandstone had been hammered into V-shaped gaps cut into the rock between the naturally formed slabs.

The expedition team began their search for Hornet with information from official deck logs and action reports from nine other U.S. warships that fought in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and subsequently came upon the aircraft carrier on their first search of the area with a deep-sea sonar drone. The warship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s identity was confirmed by its hull classification symbol CV-8, spotted with video footage taken by a remotely operated vehicle. Hornet played two key roles during World War II, including launching the first airborne attack on Tokyo in April 1942, and causing heavy damage to Japanese aircraft carriers and aircraft during the pivotal Battle of Midway in June of the same year. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7407-190213-cape-canaveral-erosion,Modern,\"Archaeologists Investigate Florida\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Cape Canaveral.

GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN\\xe2\\x80\\x94A new statistical model developed by Bettina Schulz Paulsson of the University of Gothenburg suggests that huge stone structures were first built in what is now northwestern France some 6,800 years ago, and that megalithic construction styles spread across Europe in three waves, according to a Science News report. Paulsson processed 2,410 radiocarbon dates obtained from megalith sites and even older graves and earthen monuments to develop a timeline for when 154 different megalith sites were built. She said the model indicates the first structures, which consisted of two or more standing stones topped with a third stone or a mound of earth, spread from northwest France down the Atlantic coast and into the Mediterranean, perhaps by sailors who traveled long distances and shared their style of building with the people they met along the way. The construction of passage graves, which are now found along the coastlines of Portugal, Spain, Ireland, England, Scotland, France, and Scandinavia, are thought to have been spread by seafaring traders between 6,000 and 5,500 years ago. The final phase of the spread of megalithic structures included the construction of monuments such as Stonehenge with massive boulders some 4,400 years ago, Paulsson said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7402-190212-varna-emperor-face,Roman,\"Terracotta Fragment in Bulgaria May Depict Roman Emperor.

NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a report in Cosmos Magazine , Jessica Thompson of Yale University and her colleagues suggest that brain growth in early hominins may have been fueled by nutrient-rich, fatty bone marrow scavenged from large-animal carcasses left behind by other predators. These early human ancestors living some four million years ago would have been able to access the marrow by smashing the bones with rocks, Thompson explains. She thinks once hominins developed a taste for marrow, they may have craved it and other fatty foods. In this scenario, the craving for more calories and fat could have driven hominins to develop tools and techniques to hunt large animals. Thompson suggests that paleoanthropologists look for evidence of bone-smashing behavior by our earliest ancestors. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7387-190208-italy-monte-vettore,Roman,\"Possible Source of Ancient Earthquake Examined.

Located in Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Altai Mountains, Denisova Cave boasts high ceilings and three chambers overlooking the Anui River, which made it a desirable place for hominins to live. The studies used multiple methods, including optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating, to date the cave\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sediments, tools, and fossils. The new chronology suggests the Denisovans arrived in the cave more than 100,000 years earlier than previously thought, or about 287,000 years ago, and left about 55,000 years ago. Tools from the earliest layers look different from Neanderthal tools recovered from other caves in Siberia, and may have been crafted by Denisovans. Neanderthal remains in the cave were dated to between 193,000 and 97,000 years ago, and the remains of a child whose mother was a Neanderthal and father was a Denisovan were dated to between 118,100 and 79,100 years ago. Scientists still want to know who created the 43,000- to 49,000-year-old ornaments made of bone, teeth, ivory, and ostrich eggshell found in the cave.

They then compared these measurements to artifacts in each burial thought to hint at the sex of the dead, such as weapons for men and weaving tools for women.

Science Magazine reports that previous experiments involving Neanderthal hunting technologies have often relied on first-time spear throwers, and so it had been thought that the weight of the six-foot-long, 300,000-year-old wooden weapons discovered in a coal mine in northwestern Germany would have limited Neanderthals to stabbing prey at close range. Milks, however, asked skilled javelin throwers to attempt to hit a target with replicas of the two-pound Paleolithic weapons, and found they were able to throw them more than 60 feet with enough force to kill prey. Accuracy was more difficult for the athletes to achieve: They hit the target about 17 percent of the time at a distance of 65 feet, and about 25 percent of the time at distances of 33 feet and 50 feet.

One of the figurines is thought to be about 2,800 years old, and the other around 2,200 years old, based on their styles. The older figurine, which dates to the Israelite period, was found in the Beth Shean Valley. Its bridle and reins, and the\\xc2\\xa0left hand of a rider were marked with red coloring that is still visible. The younger figurine, recovered at Tel Akko, dates to the Hellenistic era. Red pigment was also used to depict reins and a harness on it. Adi Erlich of the University of Haifa said horses in the Levant during these periods would have been associated with strength and military might, and would have been used for travel rather than farming. Statues of horses were thus likely to have been created to honor the rider, she explained. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7312-190122-a-sediba-fossils,Pre-Human,\"Scientists Reexamine Australopithecus sediba Fossils.

This conclusion is based on the presence of two plaques that feature the god Thoth and the Eye of Horus. Thoth was known in Egyptian mythology for replacing Horus\\xe2\\x80\\x99 eye after it was lost in a battle with Set, the god of chaos. For this reason, Thoth is seen as the god of ophthalmologists.

According to a Science News report, paleobiologist Kimberly Foecke of George Washington University thinks those high levels of nitrogen-15 might be due to the condition of the meat that Neanderthals consumed. To check the levels of nitrogen in rotting meat, Foecke left steaks cut from animals that had been raised without hormones or antibiotics outside in a box covered with mesh, and sampled them daily for 16 days. Preliminary results suggest that the levels of nitrogen-15 fluctuated as the meat rotted, and increased during the first week, while the meat was still moist. Foecke says that could account for the high levels of nitrogen-15 found in Neanderthal remains, since the carcass of a large animal might have fed a Neanderthal group for several days. She will next test what happens to the levels of nitrogen-15 in cooked and smoked meats over time. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7272-181231-greece-resolution-of-nikouria,Iron Age,\"Ancient Inscription Rediscovered on Greek Island.

Geneticists Joanne Wright and David Lambert of Griffith University, at the request of Tapij Wales, an Australian traditional owner, analyzed samples of DNA obtained from 27 aboriginal Australian ancestors whose remains were up to 1,540 years old and had been either repatriated or excavated from indigenous lands. They were able to sequence mitochondrial genomes for all 27 individuals, and nuclear genomes for 10 of them. This information was then compared to DNA derived from saliva samples donated by 100 living aboriginal Australians. Wright and Lambert found that all 10 of the nuclear genomes showed close genetic relationships with the communities now living on the lands where the remains were found.

It had been previously thought that corn domestication was accomplished in southern Mexico relatively quickly. Logan Kistler of the Smithsonian Institution and his colleagues reconstructed the genetic history of the maize plant by analyzing and comparing the genomes of 108 varieties of modern maize, 11 samples taken from ancient maize remains, and one sample obtained from ancient teosinte, the wild ancestor of the modern maize plant. The study suggests that when the ancestor of modern maize was carried to South America from Mexico more than 6,500 years ago, it still carried many teosinte genes. Kistler suspects farmers in southwestern Amazonia continued the process of domestication by planting the partly domesticated maize with rice and cassava in soil that had been enriched with charcoal, compost, and other ingredients. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7246-181214-neanderthal-skull-shape,Pre-Human,\"Neanderthal DNA May Affect Skull Shape of Modern Humans.

The structure was first built in the late twelfth century and is thought to have been destroyed by fire. When it was rebuilt, a large, central stone-lined pit was dug for use as an oven, furnace, or kiln, and the hill, or motte, on which the structure stood was made taller and a double palisade was built to enclose its summit. The excavation team, led by artist and archaeologist Brian Hope-Taylor, also found traces of a trench and a timber bridge across the moat that surrounded the motte. In all, the castle was occupied for more than 200 years. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUrr was probably partly destroyed during the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Richard Oram of Stirling University, who researched the history of the site. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is a large gap in the documentary record for the latter part of the fourteenth and first half of the fifteenth centuries, by which time the estate was being rented out to tenant farmers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7189-181207-egypt-fayoum-chambers,Egyptian,\"Looted Middle Kingdom Burials Unearthed in Egypt.

MARSEILLE, FRANCE\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Live Science reports that a new strain of Yersinia pestis , the bacteria that causes plague, has been identified in human remains from a Neolithic tomb in Sweden by a team of researchers led by biologist Nicol\\xc3\\xa1s Rascovan of Aix-Marseille University. The bacterial DNA came from the dental pulp of a 20-year-old woman who is thought to have died about 4,900 years ago from the deadly pneumonic form of the disease. Based upon comparisons with other strains of Yersinia pestis , Rascovan and his colleagues suggest this one diverged about 5,700 years ago, making it the oldest known strain of plague. It had been previously thought that plague first traveled to Europe from the Eurasian steppe as people migrated west and replaced European farmers, but the age of the plague strain found in Sweden suggests that European farmers may have already suffered from the infection and been in decline when the Eurasians arrived. Karl-G\\xc3\\xb6ran Sj\\xc3\\xb6gren of the University of Gothenburg said the presence of the plague in Sweden could reflect the growth of bigger settlements and poor sanitary conditions, use of wheeled transport, and increased contact among groups of people through trading networks in the Neolithic world, all of which may have helped spread the pathogens. The scientists have not yet found direct evidence of plague in any of these large Neolithic settlements, however. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7187-181206-denisovan-ivory-tiara,Pre-Human,\"Mammoth Tusk \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTiara\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Discovered in Denisova Cave.

Faith adds that the rate of extinction did not accelerate when H. erectus finally emerged.

Made by chipping flakes off a stone so that the flakes themselves become the tools, Levallois tools are considered to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmiddle stage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the development of stone tool technology. Such tools appeared in Africa and western Eurasia about 300,000 years ago. It had been previously thought that they were not made in China until about 40,000 years ago, but Bo Li of the University of Wollongong said the Levallois cores uncovered in Guanyindong Cave were recently dated to between 170,000 and 160,000 years ago with optically stimulated luminescence. No bones were found in the cave, however, so scientists do not know which early human species might have crafted the tools. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7152-181119-pompeii-leda-swan,Roman,\"Fresco Depicting Leda and the Swan Uncovered in Pompeii.

The study suggests people living in the highlands developed adaptations to life at higher altitudes such as bigger hearts and slightly higher blood pressure, splitting from lower-altitude populations about 8,750 years ago, or at about the same time permanent settlements appeared in the Andes. Highlanders also appear to have adapted to digesting potato starch while they transitioned from hunting and gathering to domesticating wild tubers. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7137-181112-egypt-cats-scarabs,Egyptian,\"Old Kingdom Tomb Yields Cat Artifacts and Mummies.

Trinkaus suggests that early humans may have suffered a higher frequency of birth defects, since it would be extremely unlikely that such rare conditions would not only be preserved, but then discovered by archaeologists in the numbers that they have been. Perhaps, he noted, as other researchers have suggested, people born with abnormalities were seen as shamans and given careful burials that made their bodies more likely to be preserved. A lack of nutrients during pregnancy and early childhood could also have left marks on skeletons. But Trinkaus says some of the disorders affected only one side of the body, and many were found in burials that did not receive special treatment. Most early humans are believed to have have lived in small, isolated populations, he said, which could have led to inbreeding and harmful mutations. He also points out many of these conditions would have been debilitating, requiring care and social support in order for the individuals to have survived for as long as they did. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7122-181105-greece-limestone-statues,Iron Age,\"Archaic Period Statue Fragments Unearthed in Greece.

Smith and her colleagues examined thin sections of the Neanderthals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tooth enamel with a polarized light microscope, and compared them to samples obtained from the teeth of a modern human child who lived at the same site in the Rhone Valley about 5,400 years ago. Markers for stress in the daily growth lines of the enamel indicate that both Neanderthal children experienced frequent illnesses while toddlers. Chemical analysis of the amount of barium in their teeth suggests Neanderthal mothers weaned them at the age of two-and-a-half, which is about the same age to which modern human hunter-gatherers are known to nurse their children. Oxygen isotope analysis appears to show that the Neanderthal children experienced cooler winters and greater climate variation than the modern human child did, even though they lived in the same area. Finally, both Neanderthal children were exposed to lead at least twice, perhaps from food or smoky fires contaminated by two nearby lead mines. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7115-181101-green-saudi-arabia,Pre-Human,\"Fossils Offer Insights Into Possible Route Out of Africa.

Patrick Roberts of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History and his colleagues analyzed carbon and oxygen isotopes in the animals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 teeth, and found evidence that the environment was similar to a savanna, since the animals likely ate grasses and drank water from sources fed by rainfall. And, possible butchery marks have been found on two of the animal fossils. The researchers therefore suggest early humans would not have had to adapt to harsh conditions in order to cross the Arabian Peninsula after leaving Africa. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7114-181101-florida-spanish-breastplate,Medieval,\"Decorations Revealed on Conserved Spanish Armor. PENSACOLA, FLORIDA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Pensacola News Journal reports that conservation of a Spanish breastplate that dates back at least 450 years has revealed decorative details on its surface. Recovered from the site of the Emanuel Point I shipwreck in 1996, the armor is thought to have been worn by a conquistador in Tristan de Luna\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army in 1559. At the time, the armor was probably about one-tenth to one-quarter of an inch thick. Now, after years underwater, the iron has been converted into iron sulfide measuring only about one-fiftieth of an inch thick. Concretions on its surface, however, measuring up to three inches thick preserved its shape. John Bratten of the University of West Florida said he poured epoxy into the back of the armor and left it to harden for several years to make a cast. Student James Gazaway has continued to clean and conserve the breastplate over the past year. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRight around the neckline there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four parallel rows of lines about one millimeter apart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery precise, definitely inscribed, and part of the original decoration work on the piece.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7113-181101-scapa-flow-shipwrecks,Modern,\"Wreckage of German Warships Surveyed Near Scotland.

An international team of researchers created 3-D scans of the remains of Kebara 2, a 60,000-year-old male Neanderthal skeleton discovered in Israel in 1983, and compared them with scans of living modern human men. Asier G\\xc3\\xb3mez-Olivencia of the University of the Basque Country in Spain said the shape of the Neanderthal rib cage could have accommodated a larger diaphragm, making it possible for the individual to take in a large amount of air without expanding his ribs. Neanderthals probably required more air than modern humans to power their greater muscle mass, he explained. The large thorax may have also helped Neanderthals to conserve heat in cold regions as well. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7109-181031-egypt-quarry-ramp,Egyptian,\"Ancient Ramp Uncovered in Egyptian Alabaster Quarry.

This was once the home of Carew Raleigh, Sir Walter\\'s son. After Raleigh was beheaded in 1618 at Whitechapel, London, his body is said to have been removed from the execution site and buried in St. Margaret\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Church in Westminster.

Tushingham said she had suspected the tests would reveal traces of bearberry in the pipes, which were recovered from three Nez Perce archaeological sites along the Snake River and are now held in museum collections, since it had been previously thought that tobacco was introduced to the region by European explorers. Tushingham suggests that Nicotiana quadrivalvus , also known as Indian tobacco, may have been cultivated by the Nez Perce, since it does not grow naturally so far north. The researchers explained that the locally produced tobacco was less potent than the dried tobacco later carried to the region by European explorers, and was therefore quickly replaced. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7106-181030-london-lamprey-teeth,Medieval,\"Lamprey Teeth Found in Medieval London Cesspit.

Cartilaginous river lampreys are jawless parasites that latch onto host fish with circular rows of keratin teeth. Their lack of bone means evidence of lampreys rarely survives in the archaeological record.

Measurements of the distances of the geoglyphs from the paths indicate the circles were more likely to be created close to a path than far away from one.

Friedkin archaeological site in central Texas, underneath a stratigraphic layer containing Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Long thought to have been made by the first people to have arrived in the Americas, Clovis tools, marked by their long, triangular shape, date to around 13,000 years ago. Michael Waters of Texas A&M University said the 12 spear points, found among 100,000 stone artifacts at the Friedkin site, span a 2,000-year period and suggest a progression from stemmed points, to short, triangular-shaped points, to the Clovis style. Eleven of the weapons were chipped into leaf shapes with slightly narrower stems. Points similar to these have been unearthed in other areas of the western United States and dated to the pre-Clovis period, but archaeologists had not been able to show a progression from the earlier, leaf-shaped points to Clovis-style points before now. However, the twelfth point from the Friedkin site, which dates to between 14,000 and 13,500 years ago, is short and triangular with a flat base. Waters believes that this blade could have been developed by the descendants of the earlier weapons makers, or it may have been introduced by migrants who moved inland from the Pacific coast, or through an ice-free corridor.\\xc2\\xa0\"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7096-181025-cairo-rameses-ii-shrine,Egyptian,\"Excavation of New Kingdom Shrine Completed in Cairo.

The two colonies were situated on the Black Sea coast in what are now the countries of Bulgaria and Turkey, respectively. The decree, drafted by the assembly of Apollonia Pontica and carved into a stone in the third century B.C., described the cordial ties between the two cities. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe citizens of Heraclea [Pontica] became honorary representatives of their own city in Apollonia [Pontica],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said epigraphist Nikolay Sharankov of Sofia University. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey received the right to buy real estate property there and to trade there without additional taxes and duties, not to wait their turn in judicial trials, to be given the floor with priority in the council and the assembly, to occupy the front row seats in the theater, and so on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Sharankov explained.

Genes can offer protection from disease by altering the way human proteins interact with viruses. Scientists think both groups of early humans would have been vulnerable to unfamiliar viruses when they first came in contact with each other, but interbreeding could have exchanged genes that offered some resistance to infections. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe call it the poison-antidote model,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Enard said. So Enard and his team compared genes in segments of modern human DNA known to have been inherited from Neanderthals with a list of more than 4,500 human proteins known to interact with viruses. They found that genes inherited from Neanderthals by modern Europeans react with RNA viruses such as HIV, influenza A, and hepatitis C, which indicates the genes may have helped modern human ancestors combat ancient RNA viruses. Enard also examined the sequenced genome of a Neanderthal man who lived in Siberia some 50,000 years ago, and found that he carried stretches of modern human DNA that also corresponded with human-virus-interacting proteins. These genes may have offered him some protection from viruses introduced by modern humans. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7014-181004-morocco-bone-knife,Paleolithic,\"Morocco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 90,000-Year-Old Bone Knives Studied.

The researchers also noted that the stoa had been built of limestone from the quarry of Akrotiri. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/7003-181001-egypt-komombo-temple,Egyptian,\"Engraved Sandstone Discovered in Aswan. CAIRO, EGYPT\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Egypt Today reports that work to reduce the level of groundwater at the Kom Ombo Temple in Aswan revealed two inscribed pieces of sandstone. Mostafa Waziri, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said the first piece of sandstone dates to the 19th Dynasty (1295-1186 B.C.), and depicts King Seti I standing in front of the god Horus and the goddess Sobek. The images are topped with a winged sun, which is a symbol of protection. There are 26 lines of hieroglyphic text below the images. The stone has been broken in two, but its inscriptions are in good condition, Waziri added. The second stone shows King Ptolemy IV, who ruled from 222 to 205 B.C., standing with his wife, Arsinoe III, the god Horus, a winged sun, and 28 lines of text. Waziri said this stone was found broken into several pieces.

T\\xc3\\x9cBINGEN, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a New Scientist report, research conducted by Katerina Harvati of the University of T\\xc3\\xbcbingen and her colleagues suggests Neanderthals were capable of precision grips using finger and thumb. It had been thought Neanderthals were limited to full-fisted grips because their hand bones were generally \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchunkier\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than those of modern humans. Harvati\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team examined 3-D scans of the points on modern human finger bones where the muscles and tendons attach, known as entheses, in people who worked different kinds of jobs, such as bricklaying, tailoring, and painting, and compared the sizes of their entheses with those of six Neanderthals and six early modern humans. The results indicate that all of the Neanderthals spent much of their time using precision grips, while the early modern humans may have employed a division of labor, since only about half of their finger bones bore the mark of continued precision grips, while the others showed signs of repeated power grips. Harvati said this anatomical evidence supports the archaeological evidence for sophisticated cultural behavior among Neanderthals. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6994-180926-friar-belt-buckle,Medieval,\"Remains of Possible Blackfriar Identified in Scotland.

The find is said to confirm three inscriptions mentioning gladiator fights that have been found in the city, even though an amphitheater has not been located.

The oldest layers of the settlement are well preserved, and are expected to help researchers understand how the city and its trade networks developed, beginning in the early eighth century A.D. By the ninth century A.D., raw materials were carried by ship to the city, where ironsmiths, amber workers, leather workers, comb makers, and jewelers practiced their crafts. The recovered artifacts include beads, amulets, coins, combs, dog excrement, gnawed bones, and a piece of a lyre, which still had its tuning pegs. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6967-180913-madagascar-elephant-birds,Paleolithic,\"Humans May Have Arrived on Madagascar 10,000 Years Ago.

Elephant birds are estimated to have stood about ten feet tall and weighed at least 1,000 pounds. The cut marks on the fossils suggest the birds had been butchered and eaten by humans some 10,000 years ago. James Hansford of the Zoological Society of London said the evidence pushes back the arrival of humans on the island by about 6,000 years, since it had been previously thought that humans first arrived on the island of Madagascar between 2,500 and 4,000 years ago. Elephant birds, which died out about 1,000 years ago, may have coexisted with humans for more than 9,000 years, but scientists do not yet know who the people who first arrived on Madagascar were or from where they originated. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6965-180912-copan-animal-trade,Pre-Columbian,\"Bone Analysis Suggests the Maya Caged Big Cats. FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Live Science reports that some of the pumas and jaguars slaughtered and buried at the Maya site of Cop\\xc3\\xa1n as early as the fifth-century A.D. may have been raised in captivity. Nawa Sugiyama of George Mason University and her colleagues analyzed isotopes in the bones and teeth of big cats whose remains were uncovered in five ritual sites in the ancient city. Some of the bones had high levels of C4, a molecule common in agricultural plants, which suggests the cats were fed animals that ate plants raised by humans, and hence that the cats lived in captivity. Other big cat bones had high levels of C3, a molecule found in wild plants, which suggests these animals were killed in the wild. The remains of animals such as deer, owls, spoonbills, and crocodiles were tested as well. Isotope analysis suggests some of these animals originated in distant regions of the Cop\\xc3\\xa1n Valley. Sugiyama said the Maya practice of trading wild and captured animals for ritual purposes may have been more extensive than previously thought. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6964-180912-scotland-neolithic-pottery,Neolithic,\"Hundreds of Neolithic Pots Unearthed in Scotland.

The mortars were found in northern Israel, near Raqefet Cave. Evidence of bread baked by the Natufians between 11,600 and 14,600 years ago was recently found in northeastern Jordan. The researchers, led by Li Liu of Stanford University, said they cannot be sure which of the two foodstuffs is older, but both the beer and the bread were probably used for feasting, and predate the known production of domesticated grains in the Levant by about 4,000 years. Analysis of the residues on the mortars suggest the beer was made with seven different species of plants, including wheat or barley, oats, legumes, and bast fibers such as flax. The scientists think the Natufians first germinated the grain and produced malt, heated the mash, and then fermented it with wild yeast, resulting in a thin mash or gruel. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6962-180912-blombos-cave-ochre,Paleolithic,\"Scientists Date Ochre Pattern on South African Rock Fragment.

Because the six thin lines crossed by three additional lines end abruptly at the edge of the stone, the scientists think they were part of a larger design on a grindstone cobble that helped process ochre rocks into powder used to make paint. Microscopic examination and experimental reproduction of the design revealed that some of narrow the lines had been made with single strokes of an ochre crayon, which must have been hard and pointed, while others were made with a rubbing motion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen we reproduced the lines, you have to have a very firm hand and have to apply the ochre quite determinedly to make them look like that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Henshilwood explained.

COLOGNE, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to an Associated Press report, a new study suggests that periods of cold, dry climate may have helped modern humans displace Neanderthals from Europe. Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago, just a few thousand years after Homo sapiens arrived in Europe. Scientists have proposed a number of explanations, including an epidemic that targeted Neanderthals and competition for scarce resources. The new study draws on previously available data along with new findings on the ancient climate from two caves in Romania. It focuses on two cold, dry periods: One beginning around 44,000 years ago and lasting 1,000 years, and another beginning around 40,800 years ago and lasting 600 years. Both climate events coincided with the disappearance of Neanderthal artifacts and the appearance of signs of modern humans in sites in the Danube River valley and France. Climate shift would have likely replaced forest with shrub-filled grassland, to which modern humans may have been better adapted than Neanderthals. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhether they moved or died out, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael Staubwasser of the University of Cologne in Germany. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6925-180827-chatham-english-settlement,Medieval,\"Cape Cod Dig Reveals 17th-Century Settlement.

Human finger bones dating back more than 300,000 years are extremely rare in the fossil record, making it difficult to know how well human ancestors were able to manipulate objects. So, Alastair Key of the University of Kent and his team attached sensors to the hands of modern flint knappers in order to measure the grips and strength required to reproduce stone tools using different techniques. The study suggests that a stronger grip would have been necessary to make the highly modified and shaped stone tools found in the Boxgrove quarry than to produce simpler tools. Key said such strong, dexterous hands would have been able to make a wide variety of objects from wood, antler, and bone, too. Human intelligence is thought to have evolved in an interactive process alongside manual dexterity, he added. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6919-180824-israel-chalcolithic-culture-shift,Neolithic,\"DNA Study Tracks Ancient Migration to Israel.

Overall, the people in the study had genomes that were closely related to people who lived in Anatolia and the Zagros Mountains. And, while some of the artifacts and ossuaries in the cave are typical of those found in the southern Levant, others look like they could have been made in the northern regions of the Near East.

The scientists suggest the disease may have resulted from the weaker sunshine in northern Europe, which can make it harder for the body to absorb vitamin D, and the fact that parents in the northern parts of the Roman Empire probably kept their children inside more of the time in an effort to protect them from the cool, cloudy climate. Children who lived near the Mediterranean Sea would have likely been exposed to more sunshine throughout the year, which would have helped to strengthen their bones, unless they lived in crowded apartment buildings, such as those found in the Rome\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seaport of Ostia.

Discovered in the 1970s, the grave of the Cerro Esmeralda mummies contained the remains of a young woman around the age of 18, and an approximately nine-year-old girl. The two are thought to have been killed in a ritual Inca sacrifice, before their bodies had been placed in the fetal position in the grave, along with more than 100 artifacts. Fabric in the grave was colored with bright-red pigment, which the Inca usually produced using the mineral hematite.

This model resembles a river braided together by many streams weaving into and out of each other, rather than an evolutionary tree with one trunk and many branches. For example, fossils from South Africa and Ethiopia, dating back 300,000 years, exhibit a complex mix of archaic and modern features. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeople back then looked more different to each other than any populations do today,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Scerri explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hard to answer what an early Homo sapiens looked like.

Three of the bones were identified as the bones of grey whales, which disappeared from the North Atlantic in the eighteenth century A.D. and are now only found in the northern Pacific Ocean. As many as three of the bones in the study were identified as North Atlantic right whale bones. Right whales used to breed off the northern coast of Spain, but are now only found in the Western North Atlantic.

The bones in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9climb pit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were first spotted by a utility crew in 2014, and are thought to have been buried by field surgeons after the three-day Battle of Second Manassas, which is also known as the Second Battle of Bull Run. In all, two complete skeletons, 11 limbs, bullet fragments, and buttons from Union uniforms have been recovered from the pit. All of the limbs bear evidence of wounds and amputation cuts.

UPPSALA, SWEDEN\\xe2\\x80\\x94A report in New Historian states that the practice of large-scale whaling may be several centuries older than previously thought. Andreas Hennius of Uppsala University and his colleagues examined board-game pieces dating to the Late Iron Age in museum collections in Sweden, and found that most of them were made of whalebone dating to the mid-sixth century A.D. The large supply and standardized forms of the game pieces suggest the scale of production was beyond the whalebone supply available from the carcasses of beached whales. Analysis of the game pieces with ZooMS, or Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometer, showed they had all been made from the bones of the North Atlantic right whale, or Eubalaena glacialis , which swam slowly and close to shore, and floated after it was killed because it had so much blubber. In Norway, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of large boathouses and features for processing blubber that also date to the sixth century. The researchers think the game pieces may have been crafted in Norway and transported to Sweden. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6732-180619-denmark-viking-colors,Medieval,\"Possible Viking Color Palette Revealed.

Discovered on the Anzick family property in 1968 during construction work, the body and the tools had all been covered with red ochre. Previous study of the remains indicated the child died some 12,700 years ago, but questioned whether the tools had been buried at the same time. Some scholars thought the antler artifacts may have been handed down over generations, thus accounting for their older dates. The new tests, conducted from samples retrieved before the remains were reburied in 2014, isolated the amino acid hydroxyproline from the human bones and the antler artifacts, in order to conduct a test that would not be affected by contamination with modern carbon.

Feldman and his team conducted 18 simulations that took into account factors such as Y chromosome mutations, competition between groups, and death. The study suggests that warfare among people living in clans made up of males from the same line of descent could have wiped out entire male lineages and decreased the diversity of the Y chromosome. In this scenario, there are not dramatically fewer males, but there was significantly less diversity in their genes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn that same group, the women could have come from anywhere,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Feldman said.

The team analyzed genomes obtained from 27 ancient skeletons found across Iceland, and found that these early settlers of the island had genes associated with populations from Norway, Sweden, Ireland, and Scotland. The researchers then used a computer simulation to model the change to predominantly Norse ancestry, and found evidence for genetic drift, or random fluctuations in gene frequencies, which has been seen in isolated populations of animals. The study notes that recent immigration from Scandinavia, and especially from Denmark, also had an impact on Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gene pool. The scientists note that those settlers with Gaelic ancestry were likely to have been enslaved, giving those with Norse ancestry a reproductive advantage. In addition, the enslaved may have been buried in unmarked graves, possibly leaving them underrepresented in the test sample. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6659-180601-sicily-olive-oil,Bronze Age,\"New Dates Push Back Use of Olive Oil in Italy.

To determine how long rocks from four islands along the southeastern coast of Alaska had been exposed to air, Lesnek measured the concentration of beryllium-10 in the rocks. Since cosmic rays change individual oxygen-16 atoms in quartz to beryllium-10 atoms, higher levels of beryllium-10 translate to longer exposure. The study also indicates that the early migrants from Beringia would have found plenty of plant and animal life along the Pacific coastline. Lesnek and her colleagues reexamined animal bones recovered from caves, and adjusted their radiocarbon dates for the effects of marine diets. The results suggest that the oldest bones had been left behind by carnivores some 45,000 years ago. The researchers also found a lack of bones dating to between 20,000 and 17,000 years ago, which could suggest the area had been covered in ice in the years before the Beringians took to the sea. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6654-180530-constantine-bronze-finger,Roman,\"Constantine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bronze Finger Found in France.

Previous studies have determined that \\xc3\\x96tzi may have suffered from bad teeth and knees, propensity to ulcers, and perhaps even Lyme disease, before he likely died around the age of 46 from a blow to the head and an arrow wound in his shoulder. The new study has revealed three calcifications in the region of his heart. Scientists say these hardened plaques put him at an increased risk of a heart attack. He also had calcifications around his carotid artery, and in the arteries at the base of his skull, which could have increased his risk of stroke. An earlier study had found that \\xc3\\x96tzi carried a genetic predisposition for atherosclerosis, or a narrowing of the arteries from fatty deposits.

The experts examined layers of ice measuring some 1,300 feet deep, and obtained about 12 measurements of lead levels trapped in the ice for each year from 1100 B.C. to A.D. 800. The resulting 1,900-year timeline offers a detailed picture of pollution related to smelting silver, dust, and volcanic emissions. The study suggests that Roman lead pollution peaked in the first century A.D., during the height of the Empire when many silver coins were minted, and dropped dramatically around the year 165, likely due to the devastation brought by the Antonine Plague. A third-century drop has been attributed to the political instability brought on by the so-called Plague of Cyprian. The scientists also recorded dips in the level of lead pollution during times of war in Spain, where a lot of lead-silver smelting took place. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6623-180516-bulgaria-roman-villa,Roman,\"Roman Villa Unearthed in Eastern Bulgaria.

In Wenceslas Square, the team, led by archaeologist Petr Starec, found evidence of the market where horses were traded and agricultural products and crafts were sold from the mid-fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries. Starec said the markets and the dwellings in the area produced a lot of waste, including the bones of cattle, sheep, and goats; pottery; and horseshoes, so the muck was periodically covered with layers of pebbles from the Vltava River. A two-inch-tall Christian statue depicting the Virgin Mary holding the child Jesus was also recovered from the layers of Wenceslas Square.

Clyde Shago of the National Museum of the Philippines has found butchered rhino bones and stone tools at Kalinga, an archaeological site on the island of Luzon. The enamel of one of the animal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teeth was dated to about 709,000 years old, which corresponds with the results of electronic spin resonance testing of the sediments above and below the fossils and artifacts. The discovery is said to push back the known date for ancestral human occupation of the Philippines by more than 600,000 years. Archaic human fossils have not been found at the site, however, so scientists are not sure who butchered the rhino, but Homo erectus is a likely candidate. Homo erectus is thought to have evolved in Africa nearly two million years ago, and Homo erectus fossils of the same age as the site in the Philippines have been found in China and Java. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6589-180502-neanderthal-symbolic-art,Pre-Human,\"Marks on Neanderthal Flint Flake Analyzed.

Distinctive, curved cuts have been found in the hard stone conglomerate at Mycenaean palaces, and scholars have surmised that they were made with some kind of swinging blade, but no ancient blades or evidence for pendulum saws have been found to date. With the help of his father, George, who is a plumber, Blackwell constructed the eight-foot-tall pendulum and a frame that would allow it to swing, and tested it with four bronze blades of varying shapes, including a long, curved blade; a triangular blade with a rounded tip; a short, straight-edged saw; and a long, straight-edged saw with rounded corners. The surface of the limestone cut during the testing was lubricated with water and sand every two minutes. The experiment shows that the straight blade with rounded corners produced a cut resembling those found at Mycenaean sites. Blackwell said that after a deep enough cut was made, a worker could have chiseled and hammered off stone on one side of the incision. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6587-180502-german-tribes-battle,Roman,\"Relics of Revolt Against the Romans Found in Germany.

Bonfires and wood torches were the primary source of light up until about 7,000 years ago, Tunia said, until simple pottery lamps came into use alongside the development of pottery for storage and cooking. Early lamps consisted of a wick made of plant material submerged in a flammable substance held in a shallow vessel. Many such vessels dating to the late Mesolithic and early Neolithic periods have been found in northern Poland, near the Baltic Sea, where the fat of marine animals could have been used as fuel. This could explain why similar lamps are not found in southern Poland, Tunia explained. There, charcoal found at a Neolithic flint mine is thought to have been left behind from torches used for light. Charcoal lines on the walls of the mine may have been made by rubbing the tip of the torch on the wall to create a larger flame. Lights would also have been needed to light the inside of dwellings, Tunia said, because doors and windows were limited in order to provide shelter and keep in warmth. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6580-180430-peru-children-llamas,Pre-Columbian,\"Remains of Sacrificed Children and Young Llamas Found in Peru.

Researchers led by Leslea Hlusko of the University of California-Berkeley suggest a genetic mutation that became prevalent among the ancestors of Native Americans some 20,000 years ago may have helped them survive the dark, cold Arctic climate of Beringia by enhancing mothers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 milk ducts and increasing the amount of fat and vitamin D passed to infants.

Researchers led by archaeologist Liz Mordue of Northamptonshire County Council discovered a possible entranceway to the enclosure on the southern side of the outer ditch. It may have been closed as a way of marking the end of its use. No entrance has been found in the inner ditch. The structure is thought to have been part of a Neolithic ceremonial landscape on the floodplain of the River Nene.\"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6560-180420-north-america-dogs,Paleolithic,\"New Dates Reveal North America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Oldest-Known Dogs.

PARIS, FRANCE\\xe2\\x80\\x94Paleontologists Alain Froment and Fernando Ramirez Rozzi of the French National Center for Scientific Research suggest a hole in a cow skull uncovered at the Neolithic site of Champ-Durand in southwestern France could be evidence of a surgical procedure. According to a Gizmodo report, their analysis of the hole found no trace of fracturing or splintering, indicating it was not caused by goring from another cow, or a puncture from a powerful blow with a stone tool. The wound does, however, resemble holes found in human skulls attributed to the practice of trepanation. The hole in the cow skull shows no signs of healing, so either the animal did not survive the procedure, or it was already dead when the procedure was performed. Froment and Rozzi note that cows were common during the Neolithic period, so it was unlikely the surgeon needed to save the life of a food animal. They think the operation may have been practice for trepanation on humans. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6556-180419-scotland-distance-stone,Roman,\"Pigments Detected on Roman Stone in Scotland.

The study suggests that people in the region heavily relied on fish, which made up just over half of their protein intake, and that they ate locally sourced foods. Those who lived by lakes and rivers ate carp, perch, and pike regularly, while those who lived by the sea ate mostly cod, but also herring, pollock, haddock, and dogfish. Adam Boethius of Lund University said the prevalence of fish in the Stone Age diet could indicate that people living in Scandinavia were not as mobile as previously believed. Seal meat made up 10 percent of the diet, and land animals, such as wild boar and red deer made up about 37 percent, while plants, mushrooms, berries, and nuts accounted for only about three percent of the foods eaten by Stone Age Scandinavians at one settlement. The prevalence of fish in the diet may have been underestimated in the past because the delicate bones are difficult to detect at archaeological sites. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6499-early-migrants-may-have-traveled-beyond-the-levant,Paleolithic,\"Early Migrants May Have Traveled Beyond the Levant.

Huw Groucutt of the University of Oxford and his colleagues identified the bone by comparing a 3-D model of it to the finger bones of other modern humans and Neanderthals, whose finger bones are usually shorter and squatter. The age of the bone was determined with a technique called uranium series dating, which measures the ratio between radioactive elements in bone. The fossils of other African animals found at the site, such as those of hippos, wild cattle, and antelope, also dated to the same time period, suggesting that at the time it had a far more inviting and hospitable climate than it does today. But genetic studies have indicated that today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s living non-Africans are descended from people who dispersed from Africa some 60,000 years ago.

Scholars speculate the Vikings may have used ultrapure crystals of calcite, cordierite, and tourmaline to split sunlight and spot the rings of polarized light around the sun. This would make navigation possible on a cloudy day, when the sun is otherwise hidden. Sunstones are mentioned in Viking literature, but no such crystal has been found at any Viking shipwreck site. The simulation tested travel between the spring equinox and the summer solstice, and varied in the amount of cloud coverage, the type of crystal, and how often a navigator might have used a sunstone to find the sun and adjust the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s course. The simulations suggest that if the Vikings had checked the position of the sun every three hours or less, in an equal number of morning and afternoon readings, they could have successfully navigated to their destinations more than 90 percent of the time. Slight differences were found in the performance of the different minerals as well. Cordierite was found to be the most reliable overall. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6492-180404-neanderthal-inhale-exhale,Pre-Human,\"New Thoughts on Neanderthal Nasal Passages.

The tomb, located in the necropolis of Deir el-Bersha, belonged to Djehutynakht, a Middle Kingdom governor, but it was ransacked, robbed, and set on fire in antiquity. Scholars have been unsure whether the head, now housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, belonged to the governor or his wife. A CT scan of the head in 2005 revealed it was missing its cheek bones and part of its jaw hinge, which may have been able to help scientists determine whether the skull had belonged to a man or a woman. But a new genetic study of material from one of its molars has solved the mystery. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI honestly didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it to work because at the time there was this belief that it was not possible to get DNA from ancient Egyptian remains,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Odile Loreille, an F.B.I. forensic scientist.

The samples were taken from bones and teeth, ground into a fine powder, and treated with a mild hypochlorite solution to remove any contaminants. Analysis of the genomes revealed that these five Neanderthals shared a common ancestor some 150,000 years ago with another Neanderthal individual whose genome was sequenced from remains found in Siberia. Researcher Svante Paabo added that the new research supports previous findings suggesting that Neanderthals and Denisovans shared an unidentified common ancestor some 400,000 years ago. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6456-180321-germany-mexico-repatriation,Pre-Columbian,\"Germany Repatriates Olmec Artifacts to Mexico.

PANAMA CITY, PANAMA\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Science Magazine reports that chemical analysis of the isotopes in animal bones unearthed in the ancient Maya city of Seibal determined which of the animals ate a diet rich in forest plant material, and were therefore wild, and which animals ate maize, and were therefore kept by humans. Archaeologist Ashley Sharpe of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute said dozens of turkeys, dogs, and one large cat that may have been a jaguar had all been fed maize-based diets. The bones of those dogs have been radiocarbon dated to between 450 and 300 B.C., making them the earliest known animals to have been domesticated by the Maya. These small, Chihuahua-like dog bones bore no signs of butchery, although Sharpe notes that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean they weren\\'t consumed. One pair of dogs from this period had isotope levels that suggested they had lived in Guatemala\\xe2\\x80\\x99s volcanic highlands before they were buried near a pyramid in Seibal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central plaza. The cats, whose remains date to between 450 and 350 B.C., may have served a similar ceremonial use.

WASHINGTON, D.C.\\xe2\\x80\\x94According to a Science News report, Rick Potts of the Smithsonian Institution and his colleagues suggest that early humans may have entered the Middle Stone Age tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The researchers analyzed soil samples taken from the Olorgesailie Basin of Kenya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Rift Valley, and noted that frequent changes in the climate and earthquakes transformed the resources available to human ancestors. Erosion has destroyed about 180,000 years of the geological record at the site, but Potts said that during that time, there must have been a rapid period of evolution because lumps of pigment and new types of tools appear when the geological record resumed some 320,000 years ago. The toolmakers had shifted from sharpening large hand axes to making smaller tools, such as sharp flakes mounted on spears to be used as projectiles, and blades and points made from obsidian. Obsidian is not available locally, which suggests the toolmakers had to travel and perhaps interact with other human groups to obtain it. No hominid fossils have been found at the site, however, so researchers cannot be sure that Homo sapiens made the artifacts. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6441-180316-north-african-genome,Paleolithic,\"15,000-Year-Old African Genomes Analyzed.

DUISBURG, GERMANY\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Science Magazine reports that volcano biologist Hardy Pfanz of the University of Duisburg-Essen and his colleagues measured the concentration of carbon dioxide emitted from the cave-like grotto at the temple dedicated to Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld, in Hierapolis. The visible mist still pours from deep fissures in the earth under the Plutonium into an open-air arena surrounded by raised stone seating. Pfanz and his team found that the warmth of the sun during the day dissipates the gas, but in the cool of the night, the gas, which is slightly heavier than the air, collects on the floor of the arena. At dawn, the concentration of carbon dioxide on the arena floor would have been strong enough to kill animals and people within a few minutes. Pfanz suggests the temple priests probably led bulls and other animals into \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe gates of hell\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for sacrifice in the morning, when their heads would not have risen above the layer of gas, while the priests themselves would have been safe.

The buckle, which bears an image of the double-headed imperial eagle and the Austrian coat of arms, was the type issued to soldiers in the Austrian Army. During World War I, the castle was a working barracks and a military prison. The lost buckle may have been a souvenir collected by a Scottish soldier, or it may have belonged to a prisoner of war. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century clay tobacco pipes, a small knife, and a lead musket ball were also found in the area of the Back Walk. A midden closer to the castle yielded pottery and stoneware dating to the medieval period. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6382-180215-france-rabbit-domestication,Medieval,\"When Were Rabbits Domesticated?.

He and his colleagues tried to trace the origins of a tale alleging that Christian monks in Southern France first tamed the creatures in A.D. 600, after Pope Gregory issued a proclamation stating that fetal rabbits, known as laurices, were fish, and could therefore be eaten during Lent, a time when meat consumption is traditionally restricted. Pease says there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no evidence to back the story, and that DNA evidence suggests that the history of rabbit domestication does not have a distinct beginning.

Known as the Sunghir burials, the graves included the remains of two boys, aged ten and 12 years old, who had been buried together with more than 10,000 mammoth ivory beads, more than 20 armbands, some 300 pierced fox teeth, 16 ivory mammoth spears, carved artifacts, and deer antlers. In addition, two human fibulas had been laid across the boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 chests. Trinkaus noted that a 40-year-old man had been buried with similar items, but far fewer of them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrom the point of view of the mortuary behavior, the burial of the adult is, in fact, very different from the burial of the children,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. The children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skeletons suggest they had experienced periods of nutritional stress, and would not have been able to contribute to the highly mobile community in the way the full-grown man may have. The ten-year-old had short, bowed thigh bones, but he was physically active.

High-ranking elites are thought to have been buried in structures built against a cliff face, while non-elites were buried in caves and under rocky overhangs. Some of the bones and sediments were radiocarbon dated, so that Velasco could track how skull shapes changed over time. He found that about three-quarters of the 114 elite skulls dating to the late pre-Inca period, between A.D. 1300 and 1450, had been modified, and more than 60 percent of the modified skulls had been elongated. Velasco thinks the elongated style may have been preferred by elites, and speculates that their unity may have helped the Collaguas negotiate a peaceful integration into the Inca Empire. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6377-180214-netherlands-oldest-art,Pre-Human,\"Ice-Age Artifacts Dated in the Netherlands.

Some 8,000 years ago, the burial, now in a forested region, was at the bottom of a lake. The skulls of seven of the hunter-gatherer adults bore signs of partially healed blunt-force trauma. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomebody gave them love and care after this [trauma] and healed them back to life again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Fredrik Hallgren of the Cultural Heritage Foundation in V\\xc3\\xa4ster\\xc3\\xa5s, Sweden.

The surviving brain tissue suggests the person was placed in the water shortly after death, but some of the other skulls may have been placed there long after the deaths of the individuals. The carefully arranged bones of wild boar, red deer, moose, and roe deer were also found. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very enigmatic structure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hallgren said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the reason why they did this and why they put it under water.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6218-171218-denmark-sun-stone,Neolithic,\"New Designs Found on Denmark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSun Stones\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

During the earlier stages of his education, Kisir-Ashur practiced his skills on animals, then progressed to treating babies, and finally adults. The texts also reveal that disease was thought to have been caused by sinful or objectionable behavior by the sick person, or the result of witchcraft performed against the sick person. After the power that caused the disease was identified, it was treated with medical agents, incantations, prayers, and rituals. Healers also treated economic and social problems, which were thought to have the same origins as illnesses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe does not work simply with religious rituals, but also with plant-based medical treatments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arb\\xc3\\xb8ll added.

Analysis of the pup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teeth revealed it had suffered from two or three bouts of the serious viral illness, which is marked by symptoms such as fever, lack of appetite, dehydration, fatigue, diarrhea, and vomiting in its first phase, to be followed by stuffy nose, laryngitis, and pneumonia. If a dog survives the second phase of the disease, it can then experience neurological problems and seizures. Janssens says the animal would have required intensive care from its human companions, and would not have been of any practical use as a working animal while it was ill. When combined with the fact that the dogs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 remains had been included in a human grave, which also contained a bone pin, a sculpture of an elk made from elk antlers, a bear\\xe2\\x80\\x99s penis bone, and a red-deer tooth, the pup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s condition suggests there had been an emotional bond of care between the species. \"\\r\\nhttps://www.archaeology.org/news/6339-180209-england-neolithic-enclosure,Neolithic,\"Early Neolithic Enclosure Found in England.

The artifacts are about three feet long, rounded on one end, and sharpened on the other, and have been dated to some 171,000 years ago, when Neanderthals lived in the region. The tips of the sticks had been charred, perhaps as a way to remove the bark from the various hard woods, including boxwood, oak, ash, and juniper. The pattern of char is similar on a number of the sticks, which suggests it was intentional. The char marks could also be the earliest-known use of fire by Neanderthals.
